But after around six weeks, I knew it was time to have them refitted. The pieces of tape that glued my extensions to my natural <a class=hm-link href=#>hair</a> weren't as smooth or as neat as before – they were starting to stick out and lose their sleekness. Cue, a trip back to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Beauty & Melody</a> salon, where I had them fitted. Will it be painful? Will I lose a lot of hair? These were just some of the questions running through my mind. Read on to find out what to expect…</p><h2>What happens during the removal process?</h2><p id=eRI2RvI22gB9 data-wc=53>Your colourist will use a special oil that contains different ingredients that help the tape dissolve. It's the most natural and pain-free way of taking them out.&nbsp;Your extensions are removed&nbsp;row by row and meticulously numbered so that they can be refitted in exactly the same spot they were taken from. Genius!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d2a1bc1b029a-hair-extensions-final-z.jpg><h2>Will I lose a lot of hair?</h2><p id=eGecG6dHlfA1 data-wc=120>Naturally, we lose around 50 to 100 strands of hair per day. This is obviously not the case when you have your extensions in, as the glue is holding your hair in place. So when the time comes to finally have your extensions removed, don't be surprised. You will lose what looks like a massive amount of hair, but it's only because you're not used to seeing so much fall at one time. My hair did feel thinner without my extensions in, but what else could I expect? I had just taken out layers and layers of Russian Remy Hair extensions, and lost some of my own natural hair. After one wash, I was used to my old thickness again</p><p id=eC5efODpLtw7 data-wc=7><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: 10 food to promote hair growth</a></p><h2>Will my hair grow back normally?</h2><p id=e_j6YIS9RWGR data-wc=29>Yes! It will feel like a bit of a shock at first, suddenly losing your thick extensions, but your hair will grow back normally. Extensions don't affect hair growth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aeeae01d01cd-hair-extensions-colour-z.jpg><h2>How long does the removal process take?</h2><p id=e3A7qArztQj3 data-wc=39>I had a three quarters head of extensions and the removal process took about an hour, with the wash and blowdry at the end. If you're having extensions taken out and refitted, expect a longer wait of two hours.</p><h2>What happens to your extensions at the salon?</h2><p id=ejXnLKW66inq data-wc=74>If you want your extensions removed, you'll simply be given them to keep in a bag until you want them refitted again. But if you want your extensions refitted in the same appointment, your colourist will wash them with a cleansing shampoo, then apply a moisturising mask that is left on for a bit. Your extensions are then rinsed, dried and re-taped to your hair. You can also have them trimmed if you ask.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e097af2c336f-hair-extensions-different-colours-z.jpg><h2>Should I use a special shampoo or have any hair treatments done?</h2><p id=eLS6C1u1WukD data-wc=35>Looking after your natural hair, once you've had your extensions removed, is of utmost importance. Beauty & Melody recommends using sulphate-free shampoo and conditioner (read the bottle!) and applying a hair mask once a week.</p><p id=eyF16oR_5w data-wc=16><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: This anti-thinning shampoo has over 5000 five star reviews on Amazon – find out why</a></p><h2>How often should I get my tape extensions refitted?</h2><p id=efOn-a7NRPWy data-wc=64>The salon recommends having your extensions redone every six to eight weeks. The cost of removing and refitting them is half the price of what it originally cost to have them put in, which starts at around £350 for half a head. If you just want the extensions removed, it costs £70 per hour. The salon also provides a one-year guarantee on the extensions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BaoaJkf3F9l2luanFlZYB6hI6hmKKqXZrFtbHNrKCopl2nsq671ZqjZqiipLCmv9JmqZ6umZrEcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-is-illinois-google-settlement-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Is The Illinois Google Settlement</span></a>
