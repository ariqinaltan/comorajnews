It's true that after being discharged from the military, where, according to AP, he worked as a Germany-based Army medic between 1979 and 1981, he got a job as a phlebotomist in a plasma clinic. His discharge from the army happened due to accusations of alcohol abuse. After leaving, he got a job in a delicatessen, but was thrown out of the hotel he was lodging in for not paying the rent, as stated by <a href=#>Newsweek</a>. He had stints living with his father and stepmother as well as his aunt, punctuated by trouble with the law; only a week after he moved in with his family, he was arrested for public disorder related to his drinking. Dahmer was fined $60 and given a 10-day jail sentence, which was suspended. It wouldn't be the first time he was arrested on this basis.</p><p dir=ltr>When he moved in with his aunt, Dahmer started working in the Milwaukee Blood Plasma Center. Yet surprisingly for a future cannibal, Dahmer did not initially like the taste of blood. Rather than drinking a whole bag of it, he took some from the blood plasma clinic where he worked, trying a vial before spitting it out (via <a href=#>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j21oaWpmZMGptc2gqmaln6PAtbHRZquhnV2fsqey0Z6wZpyRnbqmvoysq6iqqWK0sMCMsKmoppdk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sexiest-movies-of-all-time.html><span>←</span><span>The 65 Best Sexy Movies Ever: Racy, Steamy Movies</span></a>
