We had gotten it down from thousands to the final three, and Liam was a part of that final three."</p><p>She continued, "I think one of the elements that made that movie feel so special was, it was watching two very young people fall in love with each other, which was happening in real time and in real life, so the chemistry was undeniable. And that was the beginning of a long, 10-year relationship."</p><p>Just to cut through the serious tone at the end of the video, Cyrus took another glance at the movie still on the tablet she was holding, which shows her and Hemsworth embracing in the movie.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
