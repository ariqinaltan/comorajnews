The city's grit is evident in a lot of rappers' music. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Benny The Butcher</a>, Conway the Machine, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Westside Gunn</a> are just handful that embody that same energy. However, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Bear1Boss</a> is someone who totally goes against the grain. His colorful, zany, and niche sound is something that would originate somewhere out West or in some obscure city. He definitely does not color within the lines when it comes to putting together projects. That was apparent on his most recent effort <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">SUPER BOSS!</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It just sounded really rough around the edges, and it felt like something that could have dropped during the mixtape era. The random video game samples and wacky sound effects could come across as endearing to some. But for us, it was a tough listen from beginning to end. So, with Bear1Boss following up that February release with Bubbles our expectations for it being enjoyable were low.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-bubbles-by-bear1boss>Listen To Bubbles By Bear1Boss</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Thankfully, we were pleasantly surprised by Bear1Boss on this effort. Bubbles comes across as more polished and cohesive. Hardcore fans who enjoy his intentional unfinished style may not like the cleaner approach. In our eyes though, Bear1Boss still put together some interesting hyperpop and pop rap beats without trying too hard to be goofy. His voice and flows suffice, and the listening experience was much improved this time around.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on this brand-new album Bubbles by Bear1Boss? Is this one of his stronger efforts as of late, why or why not? Who had the better feature? What songs are you gravitating toward the most and why? We would like to hear what you have to say, so be sure to leave your takes in the comments section. Additionally, always keep it locked in with&nbsp;HNHH&nbsp;for all of the latest news surrounding Bear1Boss.
