This subsequently led to a plethora of memes on social media, and it's all been pretty relentless. Although Meek tried to dispel these rumors, he only made things worse. Now, the rumors are under the microscope yet again. Of course, this is because <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Diddy had his homes raided on Monday</a> in what was easily the biggest story of the year thus far.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Diddy was not detained, and it was later revealed that he is not on the run, despite what some people were suggesting. For now, there is a lot of uncertainty as it pertains to the raids, and no one knows what is going to come of this. However, on Twitter, Meek Mill became a trending topic. As you can see below, many began posting memes about Meek's alleged role in the entire situation. Most were fantasizing about how Meek was at one of Diddy's homes during the raid. They even made jokes about him hiding under beds and even hiding in the shower.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-meek-mill-memes-run-rampant>Meek Mill Memes Run Rampant</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It was the perfect example of how the internet can be extremely ruthless and downright cruel to certain people. Meek was not the only person connected to Diddy who trended online. Of course, Yung Miami also got hit with quite a few memes. Moreover, she even got hit with some snitch accusations. At the end of the day, this Diddy situation has everyone talking, and the discourse will only increase as the story continues to unravel.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-more-memes>More Memes</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think about all of this, in the comments section down below.
