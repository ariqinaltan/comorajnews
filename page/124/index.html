<a href=../../are-chuys-chips-gluten-free-html.html></a>
Answer
Basically, there isn’t anything gluten-free at any Chuy’s. Everything, including their tortilla chips, is prepared in a communal fryer. They marinate all of their meat in beer before cooking it. If you have celiac disease, you should avoid this restaurant.
Does Chuy’s creamy jalapeno qualify as gluten-free in this way? Creamy jalapeo sauce, as well as the majority of other sauces, are not gluten free. I ate at this restaurant for ten years prior to being diagnosed with celiac disease.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bridgid Coulter Net Worth, Husband, Parents, Age, Wiki, Biography</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>
