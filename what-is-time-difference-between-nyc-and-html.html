Here are some golden nuggets of wisdom to help you conquer the time difference between NYC and Ireland:</p><ul data-sourcepos=21:1-24:0><li data-sourcepos=21:1-21:162><strong>Hydrate like a dehydrated shamrock.</strong> Water is your best friend, folks. It'll help combat jet lag and ensure you're functioning at peak tourist-ing capacity.</li><li data-sourcepos=22:1-22:228><strong>Embrace the sunshine (or lack thereof).</strong> Get outside and adjust to the local daylight hours. Ireland might have some funky sunshine schedules, but hey, at least you won't be wondering why everyone seems wide awake at 10 pm.</li><li data-sourcepos=23:1-24:0><strong>Coffee is your new best friend.</strong> This one's pretty self-explanatory. Just maybe lay off the Guinness until your body clock catches up (although, who are we kidding?).</li></ul><p data-sourcepos=25:1-25:265><strong>Remember, a little planning and a lot of humor go a long way when dealing with jet lag.</strong> So grab your shamrock socks, pack your best jokes, and get ready for an epic adventure in the land of leprechauns and laughter (and maybe a little bit of sleep deprivation).</p>0956489492056110231<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfrLWiwIyiqmasmaKybrDIn52eqpWjsKZ5wZ6rsJ2Vo3qvxcJmmKecXp3Brrg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-alberti-popaj-on-qvc-where-is-alberti-right-now.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to Alberti Popaj on QVC?
