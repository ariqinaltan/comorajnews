Each year, tens of thousands of people travel to the deserts of Indio, California, to enjoy one of the biggest music concerts in America. Although the highlights are the dozens of artists taking to various stages over two weekends, the Coachella experience makes it unforgettable, with activities including carnival rides and immersive art features.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This year, Coachella 2024 will take place April 12-14 and April 19-21. This year's headliners will surely bring crowds,<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> as Lana Del Rey </a>will end each Friday evening, starting each weekend off with a bang. Also on the roster those days is a plethora of must-see talent (if you haven't already), including <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Uzi Vert</a>, Deftones, Peso Pluma, Skepta, Tyla, Tinashe, ATEEZ, and more.</p><span><h6 class=wp-block-heading id=h-read-more-tyler-the-creator-lana-del-rey-and-doja-cat-rumored-to-headline-coachella>Read More: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler, The Creator, Lana Del Rey And Doja Cat Rumored To Headline Coachella</a></h6></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Additionally, on those Saturdays, we find <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tyler, The Creator</a> as a headliner, and we can already anticipate the crowd. Joining the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Grammy-winning Call Me If You Get Lost</a> hitmaker that day are <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Spice</a>, Grimes, Blxst, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kevin Abstract</a>, Sublime, and Spinall, among several others. While Saturday's lineup may be the icing on Friday's cake, Sunday's list gives both days a run for their money.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Headlining the final nights of each weekend is <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Doja Cat</a>, who can't seem to stop her star from climbing to further heights. Fresh off a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Jay-Z-praised "Jeezu" verse </a>from The Book of Clarence's soundtrack, Doja is ready to show the world once again why her name hasn't left the charts—or nominations lists—since she burst onto the music scene. Meanwhile, Doja will be joined on Sunday by J Balvin, Lil Yachty, Jhené Aiko, NAV, Victoria Monét, and more. And to show that they can outdo themselves, Coachella also announced that No Doubt would be reuniting at this year's event.</p><span><h6 class=wp-block-heading id=h-read-more-ice-spice-amp-saweetie-link-up-in-icy-girl-s-coachella-photo-dump>Read More: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ice Spice & Saweetie Link Up In Icy Girl's Coachella Photo Dump</a></h6></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Further, if you're looking to snag tickets to Coachella 2024, you shouldn't wait. Presale tickets arrive on January 19 at 11:00 a.m., but those looking to purchase are warned that "this is a presale and does not guarantee pass type, packages, or camping," reads a press release. YouTube will once again be Coachella's exclusive livestream partner, so those unable to attend in person don't have to miss out on all of the action.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For more festival information and updates, visit&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">www.coachella.com</a>.&nbsp;Check out the full list of Coachella 2024 performers below, and let us know who you're looking forward to seeing at this year's festival—or who you believe should have made the cut, but didn't.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
