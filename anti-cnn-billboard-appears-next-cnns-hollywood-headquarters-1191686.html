Before Friday morning, the giant billboard was being used to advertise a marijuana dispensary, but it has been altered by a small band of conservative street artists who go by the name The Faction, and it is the third time in six weeks the group has attacked a TV channel owned by AT&T’s WarnerMedia."><meta name=author content="Kelle Repass"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In those attacks, the entertainers were labeled “NPC,” which, in video-game parlance, means “non-playable character,” though in conservative circles it refers to robotic liberalism allegedly displayed by mainstream journalists.</p><p>One of The Faction’s members told The Hollywood Reporter that the critical CNN billboard is related to its coverage of President Donald Trump’s summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. CNN had no comment.</p><p>“When Trump speaks glowingly of Kim Jong Un it’s a tactic,” says a member of The Faction, which remains anonymous. “Zucker and his journo-activists know this, but are more than willing to try to torpedo the summit — the future of the long-suffering North and South Korean people be damned.”</p><p>Trump’s summit had been taking place in Vietnam and the president said his mission was to get North Korea to disarm its nuclear weapons and drop its ambitions for more of them. The talks broke down Thursday without an agreement.</p><p>The Faction first made a name for itself in August when it <a href=#>peppered</a> the Hollywood Walk of Fame with dozens of phony Trump stars in an attempt to replace his real one, which activists have destroyed on numerous occasions.&nbsp;</p><p>Update 2:35 p.m. Pacific: The anti-CNN billboard remained for about seven hours before it was removed.</p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=768 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unnamed_0.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKK606JknKaeYq%2BquMubppqqlGKusbzEmqmsZZ6axbV5wqelrGWYpLmtxdaopp1lmJqupb3UmqmtnaKoenJ9mGptcW5f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amy-davidson-net-worth-82784.html><span>←</span><span>Amy Davidson Net Worth</span></a>
