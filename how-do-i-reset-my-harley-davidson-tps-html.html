The TPS communicates with the fuel injection system directly through digital signals.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>How can I do a diagnostic check on my Harley Davidson?</h3><p>Make your own diagnostic tests.</p><p>Turn the ignition switch to the OFF position and the Run/Stop switch to the ON position.</p><p>Push the odometer reset button in and hold it for a few seconds.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Turn the ignition switch to the Ignition position and press and release the odometer reset button.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Once you have pressed the odometer reset button once, you will be presented with the option menu “PSSPt.”</p><p></p><h3>There were 32 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What exactly is ECM on a Harley?</h3><p>Engine Control Unit (ECU) and Engine Control Module (ECM) flashing – Your Engine Control Unit (ECU), also known as the Engine Control Module (ECM), is a microprocessor that controls key functions that affect the performance of your engine, such as the Air/Fuel Ratio (A/F), variable valve timing, and so on.</p><p></p><h3>What exactly is an electronic control module (ECM) on a motorcycle?</h3><p>A motorcycle’s ECM (Electronic Control Module) is the computer brain that regulates different parts of the motorcycle’s performance such as ignition, timing, and the fuel to air mix proportion. ECU is an abbreviation for ‘Electronic Control Unit,’ which includes things like the engine management system.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible for the throttle position sensor to have an impact on gearbox shifting?</h3><p>When the engine is running at idle, the throttle position sensor will not cause the gearbox to shift into neutral. What it may do is force the engine to operate at a greater or lower rpm, depending on whether the sensor fails or works well.</p><p></p><h3>What should the fuel pressure on a Harley be?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The fuel pressure should be constant between 55 and 62 PSI at all times. If the fuel pressure is within acceptable limits, the test is considered successful. if the pressure does not work, see the Harley Manual for repair information Turn off the engine and open the air bleeder valve until all of the gasoline has been drained from the system.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the best way to tell whether my Harley is fuel injected?</h3><p>However, the most straightforward approach to determine whether or not it is fuel injected is to turn on the main switch and then flick the engine stop switch. The whine that sounds like it’s coming from within the right side of the tank indicates that you’re dealing with a FI bike. It’s carbed if you don’t hear anything.</p><p></p><h3>What should the idling speed of a Harley be?</h3><p>Idle speed for a passenger automobile engine is typically between 600 and 1000 rpm, depending on the vehicle. It is around 600 rpm for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, respectively. It is common practise to set the idle speed of a single-cylinder motorbike engine between 1200 and 1500 rpm.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6hprBllKR6qnnRnqqerF2ixm60wKujnrFdma63tcOspqdlpKXAb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-did-russ-francis-die-html.html><span>←</span><span>How did Russ Francis die?</span></a>
