in the country, largely due to a net loss of N153.3 billion from foreign exchange transactions.</p><p class=align-left>The brewer stated that the losses were attributable to double-digit inflation rates, <a href=#>naira</a> devaluation, FX challenges and diminished consumer spending.</p><p class=align-left>Consequently, the company deems it imperative to reposition itself for a sustainable <a href=#>future</a> that benefits stakeholders, necessitating tough decisions.</p><p class=align-left>Among the measures being considered for operational efficiency, job cuts loom as a strong possibility.</p><p class=align-left>Discussions about the potential implications of this move have already been initiated with the two unions involved.</p><p class=align-left>The company <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">has informed labour organizations</a>, including the National Union of Food, Beverage and Tobacco Employees, as well as the Food Beverage and Tobacco Senior Staff Association, about the decision to temporarily suspend operations at the two plants.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center

company's commitment to minimizing the impact on both employees and consumers.</p><p class=align-left>He stated:</p>“We recognize and regret the impact that the suspension of brewery operations in the two affected locations may have on our employees.“We are committed to limiting the impact on people as far as possible and providing strong support and severance packages to all affected."We are also committed to supporting our host communities in ways that ensure they continue to feel our presence.”<p class=align-left>The focus will now turn to the remaining seven manufacturing plants to maximize their production capacity.</p><p class=align-left>The company emphasized its dedication to positively impacting its host communities and consumers by leveraging its diverse portfolio of brands.</p><p class=align-left>It would be recalled that <strong>Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported that Essaadi stated in an interview with Bloomberg that Nigerians were no longer <a href=#>able to buy beer</a> due to the economic situation of the country.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center

adjustment</a> for all its products from August 10, 2023.</p><p class=align-left>The company conveyed in a formal communication that this price revision was deemed essential due to the sustained escalation in input costs, necessitating measures to mitigate the resulting impact.</p><p class=align-left>The decision directly results from the increasing expenses associated with raw materials, contributing to a complex financial landscape for businesses.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid
