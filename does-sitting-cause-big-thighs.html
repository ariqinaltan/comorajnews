 Moving causes your muscles to release molecules like lipoprotein lipase, which helps process the fats and sugars you eat. When you spend most of your day sitting, the release of these molecules is lessened and your rear end is at greater risk of widening, according to research. Does sitting make your thighs bigger? Yes, according to the study, which was recently published in the journal Cell Physiology. The researchers concluded that the pressure placed on the buttocks and hips from too much sitting or lying down can generate significant fat build-up in those areas."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The main reason for this is rooted in a lack of physical activity. If you don't have a somewhat active lifestyle, your blood circulation slows down, resulting in fat accumulation and cellulite.<h2>What foods cause thigh fat?</h2>The biggest culprits are pasta, white rice and bread, pastries, sodas, and desserts. These foods cause your blood sugar levels to spike, then crash soon after.<h2>How long should I run to slim thighs?</h2>Burn approximately 248 calories in 20 minutes of jogging, if you weigh 160 pounds.

For women, this so-called sex-specific fat appears to be physiologically advantageous, at least during pregnancies.<h2>What makes a female thick?</h2>Cardio is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle.
