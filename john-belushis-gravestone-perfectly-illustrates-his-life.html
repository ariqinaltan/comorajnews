It's a sad yet defiant message that seems to have inspired others to party on; according to <a href=#>Time</a>, the "Blues Brothers" star's body had to be taken to an unmarked burial plot away from the tombstone because people had trashed the area around the Martha's Vineyard site where the tombstone sits.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kGpqa21lZLewtM1mmZ6kpai1qr%2BMoKmarpWowbC6xGannqqWmrC1uNhmoKWkpajBs63TnqpmoJmoeq21xZ5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joey-reynolds-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Joey Reynolds Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
