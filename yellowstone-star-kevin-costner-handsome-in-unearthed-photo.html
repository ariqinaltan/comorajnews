(1981).&nbsp;</p><p id=e_6yfJbp_9v data-wc=34>While the actor typically rocks a shorter, slicked-back hairstyle a 'la John Dutton, his long, floppier locks in this unearthed snap have made him unrecognizable. We're definitely getting Jim Halpert vibes from The Office.&nbsp;</p><p id=eImNnz2Hgc7 data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Kevin Costner reveals ex Christine Baumgartner refuses to vacate marital home amid messy divorce drama</a></p><p id=eqdMVV2LrO data-wc=14><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Yellowstone star talks show's bittersweet end amid Kevin Costner drama and production delays</a></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Everything you need to know about the cast of Yellowstone</figure><p id=eO27pCsvFz data-wc=51><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It wasn't until his final year of college at California State University, Fullerton, that Kevin became interested in acting and dancing. But it was a meeting with Hollywood legend Richard Burton – star of Cleopatra, The Spy Who Came In from the Cold and The Robe – that truly inspired him.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMuDYJTYaqs data-wc=37>In an interview with WENN, Kevin opened up about their fortuitous meeting, which occurred in 1978. At the time, Kevin was boarding a plane home from his honeymoon in Puerto Vallarta with his first wife, Cindy Silva.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/2b16814cafea-richard-burton-elizabeth-taylor-movie-still.jpg><p id=ewugaW8Gjvv data-wc=76>"He [Richard] got on the plane first and had bought five seats all around him so that no one could sit next to him," Kevin explained. "We all got on the plane and I was burning up inside because I was grappling with the idea of acting, so seeing Richard I thought was a sign. My wife didn't even know that I was burning with this idea of what I was gonna be in my life.</p><p id=esvNbGecc_V data-wc=75>"I remember him reading a book and as I walked over to talk to him, the whole airplane sort of stood up like a wave in a stadium! I looked very young and I said, 'Excuse me sir, when you get a moment can I ask you a bit of advice?' And he looked at me and he was probably thinking, 'Jesus, five seats isn't enough!' He said, 'When I finish reading this book, yes'."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/d283ac0aacf2-kevin-costner-with-first-wife-cindy.jpg><p id=e0EDAZ2W-zK data-wc=37>After waiting for Richard to finish his book, the Cleopatra star called Kevin over for a chat. "We had a talk that was just between us and then I went and sat back down in my seat."&nbsp;</p><p id=ek_ER5d_gmp data-wc=96>Kevin added: "We didn't have a lot of money for our honeymoon and my parents drove us to the airport and we were gonna catch a bus back to the Disneyland hotel. My wife and I were sitting on our suitcases waiting and this big limousine came literally about eight inches from my face and just stopped. The window rolled down and Richard Burton said, 'Good luck', and the window went up and he drove on. I never got a chance to ever talk to Richard again so he has no idea what became of me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dYWUbWppZ6maua271qyrqKaVYsC1rdFmop6umaN6pLvSraWeql2drq%2Bw0qiknmWZo3q2usSaqa2glZl6sbTOraZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1548440-wizkid-climbed-high-mountains-slimcase-opens-longer-close-video-stir-reactions.html><span>←</span><span>Wizkid Climbed High Mountains: Slimcase Opens Up on Why They Are No Longer Close, Video Stirs</span></a>
