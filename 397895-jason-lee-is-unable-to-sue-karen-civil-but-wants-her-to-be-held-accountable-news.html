Unfortunately, when it comes to the statute of limitations on the legal front to sue her, I'm not going to be able to sue her," he told interviewer Erika Marie. "So, that's that. I feel like people see her now. If they choose to work with her, you see it and you get what you get. I think that the damage she did to herself by admitting what she's done to me and to other people is—it's out there for people to see. Those receipts will never go away. Millions of people&nbsp;watched the interview, they heard the Clubhouse chat. They heard her say she has no problem wearing orange because she likes orange. She's been who she is and the world sees it now.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">I always say to people, pick your partnerships how you want. When it comes to me, what I can control is&nbsp;Hollywood Unlocked. I can control my voice. I know that she doesn't have the partnership with Facebook that she used to have, she doesn't have the access in some areas. And that's great for us because, ultimately when you have cancer like a Karen Civil,&nbsp;<a href=# rel data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/jason-lee-reveals-how-he-realized-that-karen-civil-shut-down-hollywood-unlocked-news.139745.html&source=gmail&ust=1640114233449000&usg=AOvVaw2msiZSFA1E9XoTu-QK8zfR" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">you got to cut it out.</a>&nbsp;As far as Ebro goes and&nbsp;his poor journalism, you know, Ebro doesn't take any food off my plate.

We're all not perfect and we're all not a monolith, but ultimately, what I will say is that I thank God I'm not an employee like Ebro. I thank God that I'm in control of my voice. I thank God that there's not one partnership that tells me that I can't say how I feel."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Managing Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Alex Zidel began working at HotNewHipHop as a Staff Writer in February 2018 before becoming the Managing Editor in June 2019. &lt;strong>Favorite Hip Hop Artists:&lt;/strong> Kid Cudi, Kanye West, Young Thug, Frank Ocean.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdjboR5hZRmoZqrn6N6rbHEZqCsZaWjrqO4xGarqGWjqrJut8CrnKdlk57DqriMm6ytZaeWu7W%2FjKGcq2WkpHqjsYyhnKWcXZawpLvUp6uampyaeq%2Bx1qw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-black-widow-blonde-in-endgame.html><span>←</span><span>Is Black Widow blonde in endgame?</span></a>
