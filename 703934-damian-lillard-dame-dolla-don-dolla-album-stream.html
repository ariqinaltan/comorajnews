He is looking to be traded, however, the team is refusing to do so. Overall, it is a bad situation, and fans are waiting to see how things go. That said, fans were looking forward to his new album Don D.O.L.L.A. as it was presumed there would be lots of answers for us to dive into. Today, the project dropped on streaming services, and it is filled with a ton of features that fans should be excited about.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-dame-d-o-l-l-a-is-damian-lillard>Dame D.O.L.L.A.
