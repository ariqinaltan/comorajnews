He explained: "The Beckhams’ kitchen is a great example of this, as they’ve opted for a combination of rustic wood and stainless steel in their kitchen – a pairing that’s grown in popularity over the years. The natural beauty of the wood pairs well with the sleek, industrial look of stainless steel – creating a sophisticated ‘organic-meets-modern’ vibe."</p><strong class=fr-embedded data-gid=efmMSkzEccpF><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bab4e7e3b5ad-david-beckham-kitchen-z.jpg></strong><p id=eGrhhVJY7m9>As well as having a separate dining table, there are also stools lining a breakfast bar for more relaxed dining.
