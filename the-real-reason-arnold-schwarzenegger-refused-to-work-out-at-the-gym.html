"Even without a gym, we can also control our physical fitness during this pandemic," he posted on <a href=#>Reddit</a> in March 2020. "Body weight, or freehand, training is the oldest method in the world. Gladiators and Vikings didn't have gymnasiums. I started my own fitness journey with chin-ups on a tree branch by a lake in Austria."</p><p>"And once, when I found myself in New York to promote fitness, but ironically I couldn't find a gym, I still found a way to train," he added. "I ran up the steps of the Park Lane Hotel, where I was staying, all 46 stories, and by the end, I was completely schvitzy and my legs got an incredible pump."</p><p>So, what does Schwarzenegger's workout routine entail? Push-ups, sit-ups, dips between chairs, rows between chairs, bent-leg raises, bent-over twists, squats, calf raises, and chin-ups — 25 reps if you're a beginner or 50 reps if you're advanced. "I'm not training heavy anymore," he told <a href=#>Men's Health</a> in September 2019. "After my heart surgery, I was advised not to train heavy. So now I do lighter weights and more reps."</p><p>Well, what are you waiting for? Get to it! Schwarzenegger would be proud, right?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2loa395e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2Wv6%2B7y51krJuYrK6zxsSnnKCflad6s7HFrqqenF2pvG7DzquiZqelqXqiwIytn55ll666cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./things-monster-the-jeffrey-dahmer-story-got-wrong.html><span>←</span><span>The Jeffrey Dahmer Story Got Wrong</span></a>
