In an interview with The Morning Hustle, Williams revealed that the joke was originally his and he was "crushed" when he saw Cedric perform it on the big screen.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Well, when it initially happened to me, it crushed me just because the comedian was already bigger and more famous than me and&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he took my closing joke</a> and made it his closing joke on Kings of Comedy," said Williams. "The reason it hit so bad was that I was in the theater. I paid my money to go see Kings of Comedy and to see my joke being there and not me was about as disrespectful as it gets in our craft and I took it really personally with Cedric The Entertainer at that time."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Now, since then, I've done enough work with ten comedy specials.

Katt Williams added that as artists, you're either "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">originally creating</a> or you are borrowing bits and pieces." When asking if he ever confronted Cedric about the incident, Williams said he hadn't addressed it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I’m not that type of comedian.
