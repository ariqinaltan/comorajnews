The new trailer is narrated by Player First Games’ co-founder and game director Tony Huynh, discussing the game’s unique selling points, alongside gameplay sequences featuring numerous WB characters we’re due to see in MultiVersus once it launches next year. Naturally, this includes the characters we mentioned in our previous report, though some changes from the leaked information are evident in the first-look reveal trailer. You can see the video below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>In the MultiVersus trailer, Huynh explains the development team’s goals to make a platform fighter game that “embodies everything the team loves about the genre” while removing less desirable features and introducing new ideas. The trailer mainly focuses on 2v2 mode, showing off several WB’s characters, including Batman, Wonder Woman, meme-born Ultra Instinct Shaggy (apparently with some Super Saiyan sparkle as well), Garnet from Steven Universe, and Harley Quin from Batman. Unfortunately, the <a href=#>previously announced</a> Gandalf from Lord of the Rings didn’t make the cut, so the development team and Warner Bros. added Arya Stark from the Game of Thrones series. However, the iconic cat-mouse duo from Tom & Jerry, whose “attendance” was as questionable as Gandalf’s, did appear in the trailer, so it’s safe to say they’ll appear in the game post-launch.</p><p>&nbsp;MultiVersus’ team mode was, according to Huynh, built “from the ground up” to support cooperative play. This is particularly well mirrored in the character’s ability selection, which dynamically matches the character’s skills your teammate is playing, allowing you both to work together. The trailer beautifully depicts this system, when Wonder Woman uses her <a href=#>Lasso of Truth</a> to save a teammate’s Garnet character from falling off the stage, or Bugs Bunny digging a tunnel for him and Finn the Human from Adventure Time to traverse the fighting stage underground. Apart from their unique abilities, most of these characters will be voiced by their respective voice actors from other media, like Batman: The Animated Series Kevin Conroy as Batman, John DiMaggio as Jake the Dog, and Matthew Lillard as Shaggy – the Ultra Instinct Shaggy, visible at the <a href=#>1:57 timestamp</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/multiversus-shaggy-900x506.jpg><p>As far as online play goes, <a href=#>Player First Games</a> has equipped MultiVersus with cross-play and cross-progression features, allowing gamers to battle each other on different systems. Additionally, a dedicated server-based rollback netcode will ensure that there’s no lag between the gamers’ inputs and the game itself, which should smoothen the gameplay. Finally, the developer has announced, via the reveal trailer, frequent updates and support to the game, and the expansion of its character roster, as well as social features, such as player’s guilds, where you can challenge other groups of players to rise up, and dominate the leaderboards.</p><p>MultiVersus is scheduled for a 2022 release as a free-to-play game supported by microtransactions. Though the reveal trailer hasn’t revealed which platforms the game will support, from what we’ve gathered, MultiVersus is set to appear on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Currently, there’s no announced plan to release the game on Nintendo’s Switch console. From what we’ve seen so far, the upcoming MultiVersus could be a potential competition to Super Smash Bros Ultimate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8aapJ6rX6LCrcDIr5yrq6WoerW%2BwKKjnqpdl661ucCnZKygkZy0unrHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./requiem-for-a-dream-1980.html><span>←</span><span>Sara Goldfarb Fan Casting for Requiem for a Dream(1980) | myCast</span></a>
