Peach? The Curious Case of the Georgian Demonym</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:54><span>Ah,</span><span> Georgia.</span><span> The land of peanuts?</span><span> Not quite (that'd be Virginia,</span><span> bless their hearts).</span><span> Peaches?</span><span> You betcha!</span><span> But what about the lovely folks who call this Southern gem home?</span><span> What do you call them?</span><span> Buckle up,</span><span> because this,</span><span> my friends,</span><span> is where things get a little...</span><span> well,</span><span> peculiar.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:41><strong>The Straightforward Option: Georgians</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:20><span>Let's start with the obvious.</span><span> People from Georgia are called </span><strong>Georgians</strong><span>.</span><span> Shocking,</span><span> right?</span><span> Groundbreaking?</span><span> Not so much.</span><span> But hey,</span><span> it's a safe bet,</span><span> a classic.</span><span> You can never go wrong with a little vanilla extract...</span><span> unless you're baking cookies,</span><span> then definitely use real vanilla.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:65><strong>The Official-ish (and Slightly Silly) Nickname: Peach Staters</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:225><span>Now,</span><span> things get interesting.</span><span> Apparently,</span><span> the powers that be decided "Georgians" wasn't catchy enough.</span><span> They wanted something with a bit more...</span><span> pizzazz.</span><span> And so,</span><span> they bestowed upon the state the nickname "The Peach State.</span><span>" Now,</span><span> this nickname is perfectly lovely.</span><span> Peaches are delicious,</span><span> versatile,</span><span> and let's be honest,</span><span> pretty darn cute.</span><span> But what about the people?</span><span> Well,</span><span> by the transitive property of nickname-ness (totally a real thing,</span><span> look it up...</span><span> maybe),</span><span> people from Georgia became known as </span><strong>Peach Staters</strong><span>.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:59><strong>So, You're Saying I Can Call Someone a Walking Cobbler?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:318><span>Hold on your horses there,</span><span> partner.</span><span> While Peach Staters is the official-ish nickname,</span><span> it's not exactly the most inspiring moniker.</span><span> It doesn't exactly strike fear into the hearts of your enemies,</span><span> does it?</span><span> More likely to conjure up images of fuzzy fruit and afternoon naps (not that there's anything wrong with that!</span><span>).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:66><strong>Embrace the Mascot: The Dawg-gone Delightful Georgian Bulldogs</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:241><span>If you're feeling a bit more playful,</span><span> you can always go the mascot route.</span><span> After all,</span><span> who doesn't love a good bulldog?</span><span> So,</span><span> if you find yourself in Georgia and want to show some local pride,</span><span> feel free to call a resident a </span><strong>Georgian Bulldog</strong><span>.</span><span> Just be prepared for a spirited debate about the merits of UGA versus Georgia Tech (a whole other can of worms!</span><span>).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:64><strong>The Bottom Line: You Have Options (But Maybe Avoid "Yankee")</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:397><span>So,</span><span> what do you call someone from Georgia?</span><span> The answer,</span><span> my friend,</span><span> is it depends on the situation and your desired level of whimsy.</span><span> </span><strong>Georgian</strong><span> is the safe bet.</span><span> </span><strong>Peach Stater</strong><span> is the official-ish,</span><span> slightly silly option.</span><span> </span><strong>Georgian Bulldog</strong><span> is for the college football fanatic in you.</span><span> And whatever you do,</span><span> don't accidentally call someone a Yankee.</span><span> Let's just say that won't go over swimmingly.</span></p><p
