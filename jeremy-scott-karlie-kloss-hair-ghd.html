One of his most stand-out creations during the show was Karlie's sleek ponytail, which was crafted using the ghd Air Hairdryer to add extra volume. After prepping the model's hair with EIMI Extra Volume Mouse, Eugene revealed that he then 'squashed' into the hair to add extra definition, before shaping it into a ponytail. To enhance the look, he then straightened her hair with the ghd Platinum Styler.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/422a3d7bb4a2-karlie-kloss-hair-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eDKu8JqzFA6p data-wc=9><strong>Karlie Kloss looked fabulous with a sleek high ponytail</strong></p><p id=esw2a26I5lgm data-wc=75>Eugene took time to create an individual hairstyle to empower each and every model walking the show. "I wanted to create something wearable that is unique to each models individual character. In the past we have created strong, conceptual looks that embrace the mood of the clothes and the statement Jeremy is making. I want every girl to look in the mirror and like the way they look, then leave the show wearing the look."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/470351ade1d9-hair-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eWNapSgxRilh data-wc=8><strong>Models' hairstyles were styled to perfection with ghds&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eQaQd6ZqEjtf data-wc=68>It was important to Eugene that the hair made a bold statement. He added: "I want the girls to look sexy and feel beautiful not like a mannequin. I don’t want to be precious about portraying a specific image. The hair should speak for itself and this is what makes it a fresh look. It’s about keeping the energy constant and revisiting each girl’s character through their hair."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BaoaJkf3F9lmlwamlkZ4Bxgo6jnKudna56tK%2FOratmo5GnuaqxjKSjqKujYrWitdFmnqGcXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jay-leeson-obituary-who-was-jay-leeson-what-caused-jay-leeson-to-die.html><span>←</span><span>Jay Leeson Obituary: Who Was Jay Leeson?
