She wore the outerwear over a smooth gray fringe dress that featured swaths of folded fabric along the neckline, and paired it all with glossy cool-gray knee-high boots, which had a square toe and a block heel. All of it was from Tod’s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Alba accented the ensemble with glittery diamond-adorned statement earrings in a honeycomb pattern and—briefly diverting from the gray theme—a capacious leather handbag in camel, also by Tod’s. For beauty, she opted for glowy makeup, with a subtle smoky eye, fluttery eyelashes, and a glossy natural lip, and swept her blonde-highlighted brunette locks back into a sleek high ponytail.</p><img alt="milan, italy february 23 jessica alba is seen on february 23, 2024 in milan, italy photo by rachpootbauer griffingc images" title="Celebrity Sightings In Milan - February 23, 2024" width=2214 height=3100 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2033575860-65da07f224dce.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Rachpoot/Bauer-Griffin</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hours later, Alba repeated the method but made it look just as fresh, this time leaning into deep, rich browns. She appeared to be wearing the same wool trench coat in a coffee shade over a silky, high-neck top, teamed with the same riding boots in a shiny chocolate brown. For accessories, she once again diverted from the primary palette, holding a mini white top-handle purse and donning ultra-chunky gold hoops. Alba glammed up with a bronzy look, complete with shimmery pink eye shadow and a glossy brown-pink lip, and styled her tresses in voluminous curls with a deep side-part.</p><img alt="milan, italy february 24 jessica alba is seen during the milan fashion week womenswear fallwinter 2024 2025 on february 24, 2024 in milan, italy photo by robino salvatoregc images" title="Celebrity Sightings - Day 5 - Milan Fashion Week - Womenswear Fall/Winter 2024-2025" width=5464 height=8192 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2035114031-65da080363482.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Robino Salvatore</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today, she traded her winter formula but kept her neutral color scheme, looking effortlessly cool in a black leather motorcycle jacket layered over a knit gray turtleneck sweater, paired with wide-leg slate-gray trousers and white platform sneakers. She finished the casual look with rectangular black shades.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d41b366c-0c5e-4fd4-85f9-ab612540d1c4_1701099318.png alt="Headshot of Christina Perrier" title="Headshot of Christina Perrier" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Christina Perrier is a NYC-based freelance writer who covers culture and lifestyle topics.
