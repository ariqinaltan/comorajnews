However, it seems like he's aiming to do so with a pretty different look, too. Recently, the impersonator showed shorter black locks (Smurk ironically went back to black, as well, although not as short). In the video uploaded to his Instagram, he updated fans on what he's up to, like music videos, and letting them know there are some big things to come.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Still, there was a point in time where Perkio was saying things that were a little too close to The Voice. One instance surrounds the Chicago MC's relationship with India Royale, which has seen its fair share of ups, downs, and pleas to make up. Despite Lil Durk still wanting to be with her, Perkio said that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">because Smurk is single, he's single.</a> Maybe since then he's made more different decisions and followed a distinct path that isn't bound by his lookalike.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-perkio-now-has-a-different-look-from-lil-durk>Perkio Now Has A Different Look From Lil Durk</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Also, fans consider that Perkio was no stranger to chasing the bag off of his similarity to Lil Durk. Last September, he revealed that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he charged about $10K per show,</a> which was a lot of money for many fans' pockets. Of course, those numbers might change and even go up if the doppelgänger's rap career fully takes off. Back in December of last year, he dropped visuals for the track "Shake It." Quality tracks and a new flow or style could actually breathe new life into Perkio as a legitimate MC to watch, albeit one with a strange backstory.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Lil Durk is quite busy getting praise from rap legends, which likely distracts him from focusing on his copycats (whether in the physical or artistic sense). Recently, he reflected on how it felt to have <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a> tell him <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he motivates him</a> at a Roc-A-Fella brunch. "“It’s just motivation,” the 30-year-old shared. “Everything happens for a reason. It was for a reason I was standing right there when he walked past at the time. You know, it’s probably people that be around him every day or be around&nbsp;<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>&nbsp;every day and wasting time. And they won’t be like, ‘Lemme learn how to engineer. Lemme learn how to shoot videos, lemme learn how to…’ They just want to soak up the air. I’m like, nah, I’m gonna get to it. I’m gonna figure this s**t out for us."

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
