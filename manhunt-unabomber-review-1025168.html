Having seen seven of the eight episodes, I feel the <span data-scayt_word=tête-à-tête data-scaytid=6>tête-à-tête</span> aspect of Manhunt: <span data-scayt_word=Unabomber data-scaytid=7>Unabomber</span> is out of balance (although Worthington tries really hard). However, Manhunt: <span data-scayt_word=Unabomber data-scaytid=8>Unabomber</span> is a generally engrossing process story, heavy-handed in places, but mostly interesting in its depiction of how years of using traditional methods and failing to catch America’s most notorious serial bomber gave way to something experimental and new.</p><p><span class="lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-brand-primary lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-display-block">The Bottom Line</span> <span class="c-span u-font-size-22@tablet u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-family-secondary">Forensic linguistics prove reasonably thrilling.</span></p><p><b>Air date:</b> Aug 01, 2017</p><span></span><p>Writer Andrew <span data-scayt_word=Sodroski data-scaytid=13>Sodroski</span> jumps around in time, starting in 1997 as FBI agents find Worthington’s Fitz living a reclusive life in the wilderness. They need him because Ted <span data-scayt_word=Kaczynski data-scaytid=14>Kaczynski</span> has announced that he will only speak to the agent who caught him. Flashbacks then take us to 1995, where Fitz graduates from <span data-scayt_word=Quantico data-scaytid=15>Quantico</span>. After spending years as a Philadelphia beat cop, Fitz is older than most new agents, but he’s also the brightest profiler in his class, which earns him a trip to San Francisco and placement on the task force trying to bring down a domestic terrorist whose bombs killed three and injured 23 others over a multi-decade span. FBI bigwigs Don Ackerman (Chris <span data-scayt_word=Noth data-scaytid=16>Noth</span>) and Stan Cole (Jeremy <span data-scayt_word=Bobb data-scaytid=17>Bobb</span>) want Fitz to confirm the <span data-scayt_word=hacky data-scaytid=18>hacky</span> profile they’ve been working on for years, and they’re contemptuous whenever he attempts to steer away from the forensic evidence they’ve accumulated. Fitz finds allies in plucky officer Tabby (Keisha Castle-Hughes) and eventually in Natalie (Lynn Collins), a linguistics scholar sexy enough to threaten Fitz’s wife, Ellie (Elizabeth <span data-scayt_word=Reaser data-scaytid=19>Reaser</span>).</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Fitz’s renegade process becomes relevant when the <span data-scayt_word=Unabomber data-scaytid=20>Unabomber</span> releases his infamous manifesto, and that’s when <span data-scayt_word=Sodroski data-scaytid=21>Sodroski</span> and director Greg <span data-scayt_word=Yaitanes data-scaytid=27>Yaitanes</span>&nbsp;rise to the challenge of making people staring at pages of text for hours on end, periodically realizing things, into something thrilling. It isn’t a mystery that we’re given the information to solve on our own, so the best we can do follow along as Fitz has big revelations.</p><p>From a writing prospect, there’s a fair amount of repetitiveness. I lost count of the number of times Fitz has hit a brick wall, listens to somebody talk about something irrelevant, starts staring off into space, and suddenly makes a lateral leap based on a snippet of conversation. It’s the kind of thing Dr. House used to do once or twice per episode, so in the hands of regular House director <span data-scayt_word=Yaitanes data-scaytid=28>Yaitanes</span>, the device is at least being executed by an expert. Nearly every one of those scenes is followed by Fitz running to his boss with big ideas like trying to decipher the <span data-scayt_word="Unabomber's" data-scaytid=30>Unabomber’s</span> <span data-scayt_word=idiolect data-scaytid=31>idiolect</span> and being told to just do his job and stop being such an egghead, only to be proven right, etc.</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Yaitanes data-scaytid=32>Yaitanes</span> is able to keep the cycles of document-dissection taut enough — composer Gregory <span data-scayt_word=Tripi data-scaytid=35>Tripi</span> and editors Iain <span data-scayt_word=Erskine data-scaytid=36>Erskine</span> and Scott Turner also deserve credit — so that Manhunt: <span data-scayt_word=Unabomber data-scaytid=33>Unabomber</span> can really take advantage of its few action set pieces, like a surveillance operation targeting Bay Area readers of The Washington Post. The series also does well with ethical set pieces, such as a back-and-forth debate on whether or not to give in to certain <span data-scayt_word=Unabomber data-scaytid=38>Unabomber</span> demands.</p><p>Really, though, Manhunt: <span data-scayt_word=Unabomber data-scaytid=40>Unabomber</span> doesn’t get going until&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Bettany data-scaytid=41>Bettany</span> arrives at the end of the second hour. I’m not a huge fan of the makeup work, which mostly makes <span data-scayt_word=Bettany data-scaytid=42>Bettany</span> resemble character actor William <span data-scayt_word=Fichtner data-scaytid=49>Fichtner</span>. But that’s a distraction I recovered from reasonably quickly because the makeup doesn’t impact <span data-scayt_word="Bettany's" data-scaytid=50>Bettany’s</span> eyes, which reveal a man in a constant state of deliberation. Along the same lines, although <span data-scayt_word="Bettany's" data-scaytid=51>Bettany’s</span> accent is inconsistent, it doesn’t obscure the cadences of a man trained to consider every word at every moment. This linguistic calculation is especially key, because it’s a major piece of what does <span data-scayt_word=Kaczynski data-scaytid=44>Kaczynski</span> in. The sixth hour, paralleling <span data-scayt_word="Kaczynski's" data-scaytid=53>Kaczynski’s</span> life in isolation with the experiences at Harvard that helped shape him, is superb because it just turns the story over to <span data-scayt_word=Bettany data-scaytid=43>Bettany</span>.</p><p>Worthington makes an admirable effort, but he falls short in the clash of equals this show should be. You can see how he’s manifesting Fitz’s discomfort in his posture and body language, how his lack of niceties points to his compulsive personality. Because Fitz being from Philly is a plot point in addition to a character detail, Worthington says “<span data-scayt_word=wooter data-scaytid=54>wooter</span>” instead of “water” in one scene, and that’s the extent of his accent work.</p><p>What’s more, Manhunt: <span data-scayt_word=Unabomber data-scaytid=55>Unabomber</span> doesn’t really justify the initial suggestion that Fitz was able to catch <span data-scayt_word=Kaczynski data-scaytid=56>Kaczynski</span> because of their similarly obsessive <span data-scayt_word=worldviews data-scaytid=60>worldviews</span>, either because it doesn’t push Fitz deep enough or Worthington just isn’t able to take the character’s passion to that next level. This weakens the show’s argument, almost certainly correct, that <span data-scayt_word="Kaczynski's" data-scaytid=57>Kaczynski’s</span> paranoia about the dehumanizing side of technology and modernism was, if nothing else, sociologically ahead of the curve.</p><p>In parts that verge on <span data-scayt_word=cliches data-scaytid=64>cliches</span> of stick-in-the-mud stubbornness, <span data-scayt_word=Noth data-scaytid=62>Noth</span> and <span data-scayt_word=Bobb data-scaytid=63>Bobb</span> serve their purposes, and Castle-Hughes is very good with a character who, quietly, has perhaps the show’s clearest character arc. Mark <span data-scayt_word=Duplass data-scaytid=67>Duplass</span>, who plays Ted’s disbelieving brother; Brian <span data-scayt_word="d'Arcy" data-scaytid=68>d’Arcy</span> James, who portrays notorious psychologist Henry Murray; and especially Jane Lynch, wisely underplaying her take on Janet Reno, all add value.</p><p>If the <span data-scayt_word=Unabomber data-scaytid=69>Unabomber</span> run is successful, Manhunt will become an anthology franchise for Discovery. <span data-scayt_word="Sodroski's" data-scaytid=75>Sodroski’s</span> structural approach is an interesting one, and <span data-scayt_word=Yaitanes data-scaytid=71>Yaitanes</span>‘ resourceful direction and <span data-scayt_word="Bettany's" data-scaytid=72>Bettany’s</span> intense performance make <span data-scayt_word=Unabomber data-scaytid=70>Unabomber</span> worth checking out. I’d probably be up for more manhunts in the future. It’s definitely better than Discovery’s last miniseries, Harley and the <span data-scayt_word=Davidsons data-scaytid=78>Davidsons</span>.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Cast: Sam Worthington, Paul <span data-scayt_word=Bettany data-scaytid=80>Bettany</span>, Chris <span data-scayt_word=Noth data-scaytid=81>Noth</span>, Keisha Castle Hughes, Elizabeth <span data-scayt_word=Reaser data-scaytid=82>Reaser</span>, Lynn Collins, Jeremy <span data-scayt_word=Bobb data-scaytid=83>Bobb</span>, Mark <span data-scayt_word=Duplass data-scaytid=84>Duplass</span>.<br>Creator: Andrew <span data-scayt_word=Sodroski data-scaytid=85>Sodroski</span></p><p>Airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on Discovery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaeyt7XEsKpopZGjtba602asp5mSpLqjsdFmqZ6umZrEbn2Pa2xqbmhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fade-away-html.html><span>←</span><span> Rebelution Fade Away lyrics</span></a>
