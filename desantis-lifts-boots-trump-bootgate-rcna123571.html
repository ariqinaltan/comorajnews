Perhaps you’ve heard: Florida’s governor has been clowned recently over claims he wears lifts in his boots to appear taller. And a few days ago, DeSantis appeared on a podcast with a Trump-supporting host who questioned him on #Bootgate:
I don’t know about you, but DeSantis doesn’t strike me as someone who can take mockery in stride. I imagine he angrily flings those boots off the moment he steps in the house."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I imagine he angrily flings those boots off the moment he steps in the house.</p><p>So whatever the reason, be it pride or political desperation, DeSantis has been fighting back with some relatively crass comedy — testing out a few jabs that were, shall we say, below the belt.</p><p>“This is no time for foot fetishes,” DeSantis said during an interview on Newsmax before immediately pivoting to campaign talking points about the border and the Israel-Hamas war. (For the record, we don’t kink-shame here at The ReidOut Blog.)</p><p>DeSantis went on to say: “I know people want to try to divert onto other issues. I know Donald Trump and a lot of his people have been focusing on things like footwear. I’ll tell you this: If Donald Trump can summon the balls to show up to the debate, I’ll wear a boot on my head. This is a time for substance.”</p><p>Afterward, Team DeSantis was soon promoting golf balls as campaign merch.</p><p>DeSantis appears to be grasping at straws in his turn toward amateur comedy. Or, as he faces potential de-feet in the GOP primary, perhaps he’s trying to out-Trump Trump with his own crass humor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rr%2FNm5pnm5%2BifLW0xGapnqGUpMK1e9GeoJ2npal6o7jOoGadnaOWu7W10majop6kqHqju86tqmasoqq6sXnBqKatn5Gpsm6%2BwqeYampjaoRy</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-stone-finally-reveals-wedding-mini-dress-met-gala.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Stone finally reveals wedding mini dress two years after secret nuptials</span></a>
