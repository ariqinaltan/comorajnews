The 42-year-old is counting the start of the wraparound PGA Tour season as a fresh start after last year’s struggles, and he started well enough with a three-under round of 67 in the first round of the Cadence Bank Houston Open."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
