data-sourcepos=23:1-24:0><strong>10:00 PM (Optional):</strong><span> </span><strong>Witness the Batty Spectacle:</strong><span> From late spring to early fall,</span><span> Austin puts on a nightly show – the Congress Avenue Bat Bridge emerges as thousands of Mexican free-tailed bats take flight at dusk.</span><span> It's a sight to behold (and a great conversation starter).</span></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:76><strong>Important Note:</strong><span> Don't be tempted to touch or harass the bats.</span><span> They're wild animals,</span><span> and frankly,</span><span> they wouldn't
