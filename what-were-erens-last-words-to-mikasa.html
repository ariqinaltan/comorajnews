Hajime Isayama's manga concludes with Mikasa killing Eren in order to stop the Rumbling. It's a heart-wrenching choice for her to make, but Mikasa opts to save the rest of humanity over the boy she loves.<h2>What were Hanges last words AOT?</h2>With a final word of encouragement, Levi leaves Hange to face her fate with a phrase uttered by so many before him. "Dedicate your heart," Levi tells Hange, and she can only laugh since the man has never said that phrase to her.<h2>What did Eren say about Mikasa?</h2>Coming together for the first time since Yaegerists took over Paradis Island, Eren cruelly accuses Mikasa of being biologically attached to him. The Ackerman clan were genetically engineered to protect, and when that latent power awakens, they have no choice but to obey (according to Eren).<h2>Why does Mikasa say see you later Eren?</h2>Well, all I'm saying is that maybe between the years 850-853 Eren and Mikasa had an interaction that ended with her saying “see you later Eren” and also shedding some tears. That's the future memory that Eren saw when he kissed Historia's hand. Pretty simple.<h2>Eren and Mikasa's Last conversation || Mikasa's Dream || Spoiler</h2><p></p><h2>Why did Eren wake up crying?</h2>Eren was crying because he just finished dreaming all of the events that we have been reading. Just like how Eren was able to convince his father to eat and kill the Fritz family through the power of the Assault titan, Eren sees these memories. And he cries.<h2>What are Mikasa's headaches?</h2>When you awakened your powers, the Mikasa of that day died." In this, Mikasa's headaches were the result of Eren telling her to "fight" when they were younger. In addition, it does explain her radical devotion to Eren, even to the point of attacking Armin to keep him safe.<h2>Who will Mikasa marry?</h2>While Mikasa mentions that Jean will ask her to marry him, she clearly says that she doesn't have an answer yet. Attack on Titan fans continue to speculate, and a good number in the community believe that she marries Jean.<h2>What is Eren's true goal?</h2>Eren's goal is to eliminate the entire world except for Paradis, but keeping his fellow Paradisans alive is also extremely important to him, especially his close friends. After all, the elimination of his 'enemies' means nothing if the people he wants to protect aren't safe when it's all over.<h2>Who did Mikasa have a kid with?</h2>As the final pages of volume 34 come in, Attack on Titan shows Mikasa living life as a wife and mother. She is shown sitting at Eren's grave with a man facing away from readers. It seems the guy is none other than Jean, and the couple has a small child between them.<h2>What is erens last word?</h2>You are all free." Eren Yeager. Those are his last spoken words, after which he remains silent until he is decapitated by Mikasa.<h2>What were Erwin last words?</h2>Just as Levi was about to inject Erwin's arm with the serum, Erwin quickly pushed his hand aside and blurted out the question, " Sir, how do you know for sure there's nobody on the other side of the walls? That's when he breathed his last.<h2>What gender is Hange?</h2>Throughout the series, fans have speculated about whether Hange was meant to be a non-binary character. Although the character has a female first name, they're usually referred to simply as “Hange” (often written as “Hanji”). Gender isn't really a part of the character's identity.<h2>Who is Eren's lover?</h2>Before their final battle, the two former friends converse and Eren reveals that he truly loves Mikasa and has been in love with her for quite some time.<h2>Who is Eren's wife?</h2>Dina Yeager | Villains Wiki | Fandom.<h2>Who did Jean marry AoT?</h2>Attack on Titan Episode 84 reimagines Jean and Mikasa's married life in a short bittersweet dream. Attack on Titan Season 4 Episode 84 shocks everyone with an astonishing moment from Jean's reimagination of a married life with Mikasa, the girl of her dreams.<h2>Why did Eren betray Zeke?</h2>Why did Eren betray Zeke in Attack on Titan episode 78? To put it simply, Eren betrayed Zeke because he is not in support of their plans to euthanise every Eldian on the planet until the end of time.<h2>What was Erwin's dream?</h2>His dream of understanding the world was so strong that he confessed to Levi that he considered it more important than the victory of humanity.<h2>Who is Mikasa boyfriend?</h2>Several other characters refer to Eren as Mikasa's boyfriend, and though she protests, she usually blushes at this suggestion. When Mikasa thinks Eren is dead, she nearly commits suicide by throwing herself at a Titan.<h2>Did Eren kiss Mikasa?</h2>Severing his head from his spine (and thus his Titan transformation), she bids Eren one final goodbye by kissing him. In the fantasy realm, she's kissing Eren as he falls asleep but the final page of the chapter soon reveals that she's kissing Eren's severed head.<h2>Who did Mikasa end?</h2>Attack on Titan has produced a lot of pairings for the fans to ship with one another. Mikasa ending up with Jean is just one of the pairings in the anime. In case you missed it, their ship is known as JeanKasa.<h2>Are the Ackermans Titans?</h2>Exterminate the Ackermans. Sadly, for King Fritz, the Ackermans were immune to the power of the Founding Titan, a result of the experiments thousands of years ago. Instead of humans or Titan shifters, the Ackermans were a group in-between.<h2>Why are Ackermans so strong?</h2>Thanks to an "awakening power," which gives them physical strength far beyond humans' normal capabilities, the Ackermans are able to channel the fighting power and experience of their ancestors, essentially utilizing the strength of Titans without becoming one themselves.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lp5q%2FpnnEq5ynq12hrrTAjLCmq5yjYsGwecyiopqrkQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./watch-black-bear-sneaks-up-on-fearless-hikers-in-mexican-park.html><span>←</span><span>Watch: black bear sneaks up on fearless hikers in Mexican park</span></a>
