The late recording artist was best known for "Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)," though he also contributed significantly to activist movements around the globe. His work was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sampled</a> on several occasions in popular hip-hop releases, and he continues to be recognized as one of the few Black creatives to achieve EGOT status. When it came time for the annual Grammy Awards this month, many expected to see the show <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">pay tribute to Belafonte</a> for all his contributions. Unfortunately for them, Belafonte only briefly came up during the "In Memoriam" segment but failed to give any further acknowledgment as we saw other artists receive.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Love @itstonybennett Love @tinaturner Love @sinadeocconor. Why the @recordingacademy [chose] not to do a special tribute to you I will #never understand!" the legend's daughter, Gina Belafonte wrote on Facebook earlier this week. "Here is my Grammy tribute to you dad! So many winners you’ve mentored! So many winners you shared your stage with. You are the winner @theharrybelafonte and we are better because of your contribution!" she continued, giving her late father his well-deserved flowers.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-harry-belafonte-s-daughter-honours-him>Harry Belafonte's Daughter Honours Him</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Belafonte’s career breakthrough album&nbsp;Calypso&nbsp;(1956) was the first million-selling LP by a single artist," Gina reminded readers online. As AllHipHop notes, another of Harry's daughters, Shari Belafonte, aired her <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">grievances with the Grammys</a> too. "While no doubt, Tony Bennett and Tina Turner were special indeed, Harry contributed far more to society and the music industry than those two put together, in my humble opinion. The Grammys missed a major moment."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Harry Belafonte isn't the only celebrity who seemingly got snubbed by the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Grammy Awards</a>. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>SZA</a>'s fanbase was outraged after the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>TDE</a> signee missed out on taking home Album of the Year, but for her part, she's taking the loss with grace. "Only way from up is higher," she declared following the ceremony.
