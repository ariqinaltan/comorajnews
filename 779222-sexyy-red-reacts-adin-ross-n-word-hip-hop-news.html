During the "SkeeYee" performer's appearance, for one, the duo discussed <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">rumors that they slept together</a>. Ross started the rumors himself earlier this month after chatting about the alleged hookup with DJ Akademiks. According to them, however, they were simply trolling and met for the first time on the day of the stream.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It's far from the only controversy they addressed, however. At another point in the stream, Ross decided to show Sexyy Red the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">infamous clip</a> of him saying the n-word onstage while rapping along to "I Don't Like" with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chief Keef</a>. The viral moment prompted a debate last year about who can use the word and under what circumstances, as the rapper seemingly gave Ross a "pass."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sexyy-red-claims-adin-ross-couldn-t-wait-to-say-it>Sexyy Red Claims Adin Ross "Couldn't Wait" To Say It</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Upon seeing the clip, Sexyy Red commended Ross for asking permission before saying the word. "You respected it, I see you respected it," she said. "I like it when I see that in the crowd... He couldn't wait to say it though." Now, Sexyy Red is receiving some <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">backlash</a> from viewers, who believe she shouldn't have let the internet personality slide like that. Countless commenters agree that despite asking for permission from Chief Keef, it was still offensive, and strange that he was so excited to say it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Nah this can’t be accepted," one Instagram user writes in The Neighborhood Talk's comments section. "ABSOLUTELY NOT!" another says, "Cut the bullsh*t!" What do you think of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Adin Ross</a> using the n-word while rapping along to a song onstage With Chief Keef? What about Sexyy Red's reaction to it? Do you think she's in the wrong for letting it slide?
