Yeah I probably would, why not?</p><p><i>What is the one thing you like the most about your opponent?</i></p><p><b>Perrottet:</b> I think he is a genuine guy who is in politics for the right reasons and he is just a decent, good bloke.</p><p><b>Minns: </b>He is a very good father.</p><p>We also asked both leaders what they thought was the biggest challenge facing NSW over the next 12 months.</p><p>Mr Perrottet said it was going to be all about the rising cost of living and helping the Aussies who are being hit the hardest.</p><p>He said, while NSW is in a strong position as a state, there are “economic challenges in front of us”.</p><p>In response, he said his party is trying to “help families budgets” through things like Back to School vouchers, Active Kids vouchers and Creative Kids vouchers to ensure families can continue to invest in their children.</p><p>“We want to help with the cost of sport, the cost of swimming lessons and it’s all there. It’s all available on Service NSW,” Mr Perrottet said.</p><p>“That’s the real challenge, I think going forward, and it’s all tied to the challenging economic situation we’re in. But we’ll get through it and we’ve got the plan to do it.”</p><p>He urged anyone who is struggling under the current economic situation to go to the Service NSW website to see what measures are available to help.</p><p>“There’s a whole range of measures there, including that $250 off everyone’s energy bill. But in addition, I’d say if you’re really doing it tough, reach out to a financial counsellor,” Mr Perrottet said.</p><p>“We made an announcement to give extra support, an additional 100 financial counsellors are coming on in NSW.”</p><p>For Mr Minns, he believed the health system and rising energy prices were some of the biggest areas of concerns for the state.</p><p>“We don’t live too far from St George Hospital. We’ve got a lot of friends that work up there,” he said.</p><p>“Nurses and paramedics and our hospital cleaners and orderlies all say they thought that Covid was the most difficult period, but the period after that has been a real challenge for them.”</p><p>Mr Minns noted that many of the people they speak to have said they are looking to get out of the health profession altogether because of how challenging it has been.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“So we feel for it. It’s not just academic for us – it’s our friends, it’s our local community, the people who are propping up the health system,” he said.</p><p>He also noted Labor was committed to helping ease the cost of rising energy bills, with the Energy Relief Fund meaning eligible NSW households will receive up to $500 to go towards electricity bills.</p><p>NSW small businesses will also receive $315 off their energy bill, with eligible businesses seeing that bumped up to $630 when matched by funding from the Commonwealth Government’s rebate scheme.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label="NSW State Election 2023" data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>NSW State Election 2023</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwutKwZJqbpGS9sLjIraCcq1%2Bmwqa%2F06Kmp6tdp7K3scClZKyhnZ65or7IraCeq12XsrXDxJ6lZpyforavtcJmp56qoqTBtbHTZpinnF2YtbO10makoqaeqHyvsdasZKysn6fGcICUnm5qmWNrhXWDlWmanp2TmX11gJOab3FsYm2FcYXF</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-mcgrath.html><span>←</span><span>Movies directed by Tom Mcgrath</span></a>
