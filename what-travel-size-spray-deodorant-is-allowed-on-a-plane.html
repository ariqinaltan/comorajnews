As you prepare for your journey, it’s essential to know what items are allowed in your carry-on and checked baggage to ensure a smooth airport experience. One item that often raises questions is travel size spray deodorant. So, what travel size spray deodorant is allowed on a plane?</p><p>According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), you are permitted to bring a travel size spray deodorant in your carry-on bag as long as it adheres to the airline’s regulations on liquids. These regulations require that the deodorant must be in a container with a capacity of 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less. Additionally, all containers containing liquids must be placed in a single, clear, quart-sized resealable bag. This helps airport security officers to quickly and efficiently screen liquids. It’s important to note that larger-sized containers of spray deodorant should be stowed in checked baggage rather than carried on.</p><h3><span id=FAQs_about_travel_size_spray_deodorant_on_a_plane>FAQs about travel size spray deodorant on a plane:</span></h3><h3><span id=1_Can_I_bring_an_aerosol_spray_deodorant_on_a_plane>1.
