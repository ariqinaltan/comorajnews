Below Deck Med Season 8 is nearing the end of its run, which will make some viewers very happy.

That means the Below Deck Med Season 8 finale should air on Monday, January 22, with three episodes in the season.</p><p>If there is a reunion show, it would air on Monday, January 29, and boy, do fans need one after this crazy season.</p><p>The reunion show could and should be two parts. A two-part reunion would have the second part airing right before the premiere of <a href=#>Below Deck Season 11 </a>on Monday, February 5.</p><p>There has been no word on a reunion, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen.

Remember, Haleigh Gorman was off the yacht sick, and Kyle Viljoen finally resurfaced from his migraine.</p><p>The repeat and obnoxious charter guests were extremely unhappy with chef Jack Luby, especially his big gay breakfast. Meanwhile, Lily Davison found her groove, much to the delight of Tumi Mhlongo.</p><p>However, the biggest cliffhanger was Max Salvador getting a lecture from Captain Sandy and refusing to apologize to her. The deckhand walked away from the captain because he was hungry and annoyed.</p><p>Those who want to know how that situation was resolved can click <a href=#>here</a> for more Below Deck Med spoilers.</p><p>Below Deck Med airs Mondays at 9/8c on Bravo.
