They are spread across Australia and I would hope that most of those who lost their jobs in this state would be re-employed on new projects or existing projects,’’ Mr Barnett told a live online blog.</p><p>``I expect (Gina Rinehart’s) Roy Hill project to get under way shortly - that’s a new, $10 billion project, and other projects will also get under way shortly.</p><p>``However, the figures this morning showed a rise in unemployment both nationally and within this state, and I think we will see unemployment rise this year.’’</p><p>Administrators Ferrier Hodgson and receivers KordaMentha were appointed after the company recently reported significant cost over-runs and profit downgrades in power construction contracts.</p><p>Mr Mentha said Forge’s financiers had done everything possible to give the company time to find a solution to repair its balance sheet.</p><p>The action has left administrators to complete the Diamantina Power Station in Queensland and West Angelas Power Station for Rio Tinto’s expansion in the Pilbara region of WA.</p><p>Mr Mentha said Forge employees would receive their entitlements from the sale of Forge assets and the federal government scheme that guaranteed basic entitlements.</p><p>``There is no money to pay employees and no work to perform,’’ Mr Mentha said in a statement.</p><p>``We are working closely with the administrators to do whatever we can to help the employees at this dreadful time for them and their families.’’</p><p>He said the receivers would bring employees back to their home town and help them apply for their entitlements.</p><p>One employee told radio station 6PR he is owed eight weeks pay, while 457 visa holders had 90 days to find another job before being forced to leave the country.</p><p>Forge had 1753 employees in Australia and 814 overseas.</p><p>Mr Mentha added that Forge’s international businesses in South Africa, Asia and the US would operate as usual ahead of a sale of those businesses.</p><p>The development has cast a cloud over the construction of a $1.47 billion processing facility at Gina Rinehart’s Roy Hill iron ore project in WA, which was worth $830 million to Forge.</p><p>Meanwhile Opposition Leader Bill Shorten lamented the loss of more Australian jobs following the collapse of Forge Group, calling it a ``devastating announcement’’.</p><p>``Our thoughts are with the workers and their families,’’ Mr Shorten said in a statement.</p><p>The S&P Dow Jones Indices said it will remove Forge Group from the S&P/ASX 200 at the close of trade today as a result of the company being placed in voluntary administration.</p><p>The company will be replaced by Nine Entertainment Co after the close of trade on February 19.</p><p>The decision to appoint administrators came less than a fortnight after Forge said it expected to post a full year loss of up to $25 million.</p><p>In December, Forge announced writedowns of $127 million associated with its Diamantina Power Station in Queensland and West Angelas Power Station for Rio Tinto’s expansion in the Pilbara region of WA.</p><p>The first meeting of creditors is scheduled to take place in Perth on February 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlww8Ssq56qnmKutr%2FTq5iloZFksLC4y5qnrJ1dpLNuvMSrq6GakaiypXnCqKSpmZ6ueqe70aCcZp%2BipMKxecuemK%2Bdo2J%2BdHyPZq6irJikwrV5yaiZrGeemsS0edKtpquxX26vcnzAm51ta5RnsKSCxW1oamuRln15hJJum25sZWyw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./look-of-the-day-2023-12-29-8420886.html><span>←</span><span>Chrissy Teigen Just Wore the Winter Coat Thats Essentially a Bathrobe</span></a>
