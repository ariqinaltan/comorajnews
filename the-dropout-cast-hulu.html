Here's our guide to the cast of The Dropout.</p><h2 id=amanda-seyfried-as-elizabeth-holmes-3>Amanda Seyfried as Elizabeth Holmes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CsAPoH7naQNEpDXcVdiBYK-1920-80.jpg><p>Elizabeth Holmes is just a sophomore when she drops out of Stanford to found her own biomedical company.
