V. Prakash Kumar</p><p>Raviteja has been staying away from his most-liked genre of comedy for the serious thriller from the last few movies. The actor has come up with a period action drama Tiger Nageswara Rao this time and the story is based on a real-life character. With Raviteja being the lead, Tiger Nageswara Rao has a list of famous actors like Anupam Kher, Renu Desai, and Nupur Sanon in crucial roles. The trailer could create the curiosity. The movie was released today in theaters. Let us see how Tiger Nageswara Rao is. Here is the review from US premieres.</p><p><strong>What Is It About?</strong></p><p>An intelligence bureau officer Raghavendra Rajput (Anupam Kher) wants to know all about the notorious criminal Tiger Nageswara Rao (Ravi Teja) because the latter throws a challenge that he will rob the PM’s office. Tiger Nageswara Rao is a dangerous thief from the Stuartpuram area and he is the most wanted in Andhra Pradesh for the crimes he committed. Why did Tiger Nageswara Rao want to rob the PM’s office and what is his story?</p><p><strong>Performances</strong></p><p>Like always, Raviteja pours in his full efforts for the role of Tiger Nageswara Rao. His performance and looks for the character are appreciable, but his choice of stories is not. Tiger Nageswara Rao boasts as a real-life inspired character but ends up as a tale of the generous hero role he did in umpteen films so far. The grey shade of the hero in the first half tries to bluff the audience but ends as a half-backed one.</p><p>Nupur Sanon and Gayathri Bharadwaj appear in typical heroine roles and they are just alright. Renu Desai has returned to films after a long time with Tiger Nageswara Rao but her role is a letdown. Her role is dull and limited. Renu Desai fails to make her reentry a memorable one. Nasser is usual and Jishu Sen Guptha is routine as a bad cop. Anupam Kher is wasted.</p><p>Hareesh Peradi will be seen as the only villain in the movie and he is not powerful enough. Murali Sharma will be seen in a brief role and he is fine. Anukeerthy Vas is seen in a limited role and she makes no impact.</p><p><strong>Technicalities</strong></p><p>The story and narrative of Tiger Nageswara Rao are not at all fresh. Except for the padding of real-life inspiration, Tiger Nageswara Rao has all the bland and routine elements that any random action drama would have. The heroism elevations also disappoint as they appear to be a poor imitation of recent blockbuster movies. The background music is unimpressive and the songs will be remembered just for giving more run time to the dragged drama. The lag in the second half which is filled with monotonous episodes is a real patience tester.</p><p><strong>Thumbs Up</strong></p><p>Raviteja’s effort</p><p><strong>Thumbs Down</strong></p><p>Weak Story<br>Routine Narrative<br>Run time<br>Songs and BGM<br>Dragged Second Half</p><p><strong>Analysis</strong></p><p>Raviteja is one hero who doesn’t appear to be introspecting from his flops but will be on a signing spree. Tiger Nageswara Rao is yet another disappointing film from the actor. Tiger Nageswara Rao was hyped as a different thriller story that was based on a true character. Unfortunately, the background and the name were used for the plot which is extremely boring and cliched.</p><p>Tiger Nageswara Rao starts with a train robbery episode which looks interesting in the beginning and quickly falls flat with poor visual effects work. The first half shows the ruthlessness and brutality of Nageswara Rao but the techniques used for the elevation and heroism are not new. The rise of Nageswara Rao is shown in the most obvious narrative. Hero stealing the spotlight by doing an impossible task and leaving his villain bosses envious is a stale episode, but Tiger Nageswara Rao uses it. The romantic track is dull and tedious.</p><p>The main story opens in the second half to reveal the actual Tiger Nageswara Rao and it turns into a regular action drama within no time. The second half is a patience tester with tiresome and predictable sequences all over. Not just one episode or dialogue looks fresh in this yet another Robinhood story. From the back-and-forth narrative of flashback to the students being tortured by the villain, the brutal CI to the villain’s political influence, everything is lifeless.</p><p>It gets even more difficult to watch with many senseless scenes all over the movie. For instance, the hero gets the credit for the roads and electricity in the area because the police get it sanctioned by the government so they can catch him easily. Not stopping there, the director brings in another heroine again pouring her unconditional love for a most wanted criminal. The latter half never really ends with overused episodes queueing up.</p><p>For an already dragged drama with monotonous narrative and routine scenes, the songs are an additional pain. Songs and Background music fail miserably. For the hype given for Tiger Nageswara Rao’s intelligence, not one single robbery flaunts the smartness. The popular star cast of Anupam Kher, Renu Desai, and two heroines could not help this bland show.</p><p>Overall, Tiger Nageswara Rao is an endless boring, and routine action drama. It tests the patience with stereotyped storytelling and vintage elevations.</p><p><strong>Bottomline: A Patience Tester</strong></p><p><strong>Rating: 2/5</strong></p><p class=post-tag>Tags <a href=# rel=tag>Tiger Nageswara Rao Movie Review</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Tiger Nageswara Rao Review</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qMHLrZxnm5%2BifK671aKcq52mnrK4v45rbW1oZ2d8tbXGnqlmppGcsrTDwKuYZqqRpHquu9WinGaqlau2psOMq5ivoaSat6J506Kenqpdo66osdKwmKuZXaeusHnMqK2inV2nsre1xLA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1446878-they-go-toilet-together-identical-twin-sisters-married-a-40-year-man-want-get-pregnant-same-time.html><span>←</span><span>They Go to Toilet Together: Identical Twin Sisters Dating 40-Year-Old Man Want to Get Pregnant Same</span></a>
