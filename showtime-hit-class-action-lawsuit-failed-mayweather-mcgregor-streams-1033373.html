(Read the complaint below.)</p><p>The proposed class includes Oregon consumers who viewed Showtime’s app advertisement on iTunes and paid $99.99 to stream the fight, but were unable to view the fight live on the app “in HD at <span data-scayt_word=1080p data-scaytid=6>1080p</span> resolution and at 60 frames&nbsp;per second, and who experienced ongoing grainy video, error&nbsp;screens, buffer events, and stalls instead.”</p><p>Showtime senior <span data-scayt_word=vp data-scaytid=19>vp</span> sports communications Chris <span data-scayt_word=DeBlasio data-scaytid=8>DeBlasio</span> says anyone who had issues with a cable or satellite feed should contact their provider, but Showtime will handle complaints from anyone who bought the fight through Showtimeppv.com and the <span data-scayt_word=ShowtimePPV data-scaytid=9>ShowtimePPV</span> app.</p><p>“We have received a very limited number of complaints and will issue a full refund for any customer who purchased the event directly from Showtime and were unable to receive the telecast,” he says.</p><p>Pay-Per-View Live Events Inc. also sent The Hollywood Reporter an email that directed dissatisfied customers to their service providers. “Unfortunately, we are receiving a huge number of complaints from a large number of customers who are not using our services but a different provider (UFC),” says the message. “We can only express that we understand your pain for not being able to see the special event but again we are not the company that provided the stream or actual event. You will need to contact the actual provider such as <span data-scayt_word=Xfinity data-scaytid=12>Xfinity</span>, Showtime, HBO, UFC.tv etc. to request your refund.”</p><p>The plaintiffs are also represented by <span data-scayt_word=Geragos data-scaytid=15>Geragos</span> & <span data-scayt_word=Geragos data-scaytid=16>Geragos</span>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aug. 28, 1:45 p.m.: </strong>Updated with a statement from Showtime.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmrKCfrMGqucRmn6KsXZi5or%2FSZpicrJmku264wLCqrqGkYrOitcuem2alka7Epq3ToZyrZZ2YtLOxxqipZqukp7KiudJmaGlrY2iEdHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./779222-sexyy-red-reacts-adin-ross-n-word-hip-hop-news.html><span>←</span><span>Sexyy Red Reacts To Adin Ross Using The N-Word Onstage: Watch</span></a>
