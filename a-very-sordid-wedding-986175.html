Featuring many of the original <span data-scayt_word=castmembers data-scaytid=4>castmembers</span> as well as newcomers in several key roles, this installment delivers much of the same brand of raucous, gay-themed humor that propelled its predecessor to surprising success.

Among the familiar figures are <span data-scayt_word=Latrelle data-scaytid=2>Latrelle</span> (Bonnie <span data-scayt_word=Bedelia data-scaytid=3>Bedelia</span>), now mellowed and accepting of her gay son Ty (Kirk Geiger), who is on a mission to get married in every U.S. state to his husband, who happens to be black. “These people are not going to know whether to be racist or homophobic,” one character observes upon meeting the couple.</p><p><span class="lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-brand-primary lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-display-block">The Bottom Line</span> <span class="c-span u-font-size-22@tablet u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-family-secondary">Fans of the original will enjoy this racuous, campy comedy.</span></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Then there’s Sissy (Dale Dickey), whose determination to quit smoking in the first film has been replaced by an obsessive reading of the Bible; <span data-scayt_word=Latrelle’s data-scaytid=9>Latrelle’s</span> sister <span data-scayt_word=LaVonda data-scaytid=10>LaVonda</span> (Ann Walker), who reluctantly tends to the infirm; her best friend <span data-scayt_word=Noleta data-scaytid=11>Noleta</span> (Caroline Rhea), who enjoys a torrid fling with a hospital patient she meets while visiting her irascible mother; and Brother Boy (Leslie Jordan), the aging drag queen who’s recently added Dolly Parton to his repertoire and who, through circumstances too convoluted to recount, winds up on the road with a hunky young man who turns out to be a serial killer dubbed the “Hitchhiker Murderer.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the town’s hot but homophobic new pastor (Levi <span data-scayt_word=Kreis data-scaytid=12>Kreis</span>) becomes intent on hosting an “Anti-Equality” rally to prevent the same-sex marriages which he blames on “five liberal justices and an ungodly, Muslim president.” As one of his church members puts it, “God loves gays but hates perverts.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>A little of the film’s brand of humor goes a long way, and those not tuned into the particular wavelength of writer/director Shores — whose previous effort, 2013’s Southern Baptist Sissies, was very much cut from the same cloth — are unlikely to join the flock at this point. But A Very Sordid Wedding offers some undeniably entertaining moments, and its talented ensemble, clearly encouraged to pull out all the stops, delivers their comic shtick with admirable gusto. It’s also impossible to entirely resist a film featuring Whoopi Goldberg as a priest officiating a gay wedding while clad in a rainbow-hued robe. &nbsp;</p><p>Production company: Beard Collins Shores Productions<br>Cast: Bonnie <span data-scayt_word=Bedelia data-scaytid=15>Bedelia</span>, Leslie Jordan, Caroline Rhea, Dale Dickey, Kirk Geiger, Levi <span data-scayt_word=Kreis data-scaytid=16>Kreis</span>, Katherine <span data-scayt_word=Bailess data-scaytid=21>Bailess</span>, Alec <span data-scayt_word=Mapa data-scaytid=22>Mapa</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Alek data-scaytid=23>Alek</span> <span data-scayt_word=Paunovic data-scaytid=24>Paunovic</span>, Carole Cooke, Michel <span data-scayt_word=MacRae data-scaytid=25>MacRae</span><br>Director-screenwriter: Del Shores<br>Producers: Del Shores, Emerson Collins<br>Executive producers: Louise H.
