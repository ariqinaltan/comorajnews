In the past few months, we’ve heard new music from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Popcaan</a>, and the ever-mysterious <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>PartyNextDoor</a>. However, we’re still waiting on new music from Roy Woods. The “Gwan Big Up Urself” singer hasn’t released a full-length project since 2020’s <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Dem Times</a>, which felt like it, unfortunately, fell under the radar and didn’t receive the recognition it truly deserves.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Since then, Roy Woods has warmed up his fans with a slew of records including numerous remixes. Around the time Drake released Certified Lover Boy, Woods flipped “Girls Want Girls” into a RoyMix. Then, he shared a number of singles in 2022, including his collab with DJ Charlie B, “Speeding” and “<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Insecure</a>.” Each of these records left fans excited for more but he’s yet to provide a concrete date on when his next project will drop.&nbsp; However, we hope that it’s soon.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-roy-woods-shares-his-latest-single-don-t-love-me>Roy Woods Shares His Latest Single, “Don’t Love Me”&nbsp;</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With Valentine’s Day around the corner, Woods delivered an anthem for part-time lovers with “Don’t Love Me.” UpNorth and Crater deliver a woozy and spacey beat that’s perfect for Woods’ vibrato melodies. Throughout the record, Roy Woods details an on-and-off again relationship as he hopes for more transparency within that bond. “You know I’m bullshit shawty/ But girl, I tried to tell you not to love me,” he said. Roy clearly isn’t adhering to the Valentine’s Day agenda on his latest anthem, and perhaps, that’s what more people need around this time of year.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It seems that “Don’t Love Me” might land on his next project, Mixed Emotions, which will be executive produced by Drake. “He wanted to join the process, so I said ‘Yeah, of course,’” <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he told HNHH</a>. “I wanted to get my album the best way I could, and with his help, it was perfect. He had a very similar vision of what I wanted, so it wasn’t hard for us to pick songs and go through songs together.” We’ll keep you updated on Mixed Emotions. Press play on his new single above.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Quotable Lyrics<br></strong>Please, don't say you're in love<br>We both know that we go back<br>We're like bread and butter<br>Girl, ever since we linked up&nbsp;<br>You've had feelings mixed up</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
