This entourage then boarded a party bus destined for Arrowhead Stadium.</p><p id=exq7p7Lk5_9 data-wc=63>The mansion, worth in the region of $1 million, wasn’t housing Travis at that time. According to reports, he has a personal chef and several friends from high school and college who use his place as a crash pad whenever they are in town. But that wasn’t all; to ensure Taylor's safety, two unmarked police cars stood guard outside the football star's home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2e04ad5abf9a-taylor-swift-bleachers.jpg><p id=eW8f_rPPRqE data-wc=41>The whispers of a possible relationship between the two hit fever pitch last weekend. Taylor was unexpectedly spotted in the Chiefs' suite, where she cheered the team on to a triumphant victory over the Chicago Bears with a score of 41-10.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHwUYJdFnPY data-wc=39>But the real talk started post-game when Taylor and Travis were seen making a swift exit through the stadium corridors together. Later that evening, they were reportedly at an exclusive downtown bar, which Travis had booked for the night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1b5d79d96fd0-gettyimages-1687653045.jpg><p id=exJWf0sZsjH data-wc=29>Although efforts were made to keep the post-game celebrations private, &nbsp;a particularly telling photo of Taylor comfortably draping her arm around Travis, hinted at the intimacy between the two.</p><p id=eSXsQXpWlTp data-wc=19>Adding to the intrigue, Travis' brother, Jason Kelce, didn’t hold back during a recent chat on SportsRadio 94 WIP.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0849b845358d-gettyimages-1481969871.jpg><p id=eQbGWsLZPAT data-wc=40>Jason shared: “Travis is going above and beyond to be a gentleman” towards Taylor. He continued with a touch of humor, mentioning that Travis can effortlessly shift gears, suggesting that he can balance his blossoming relationship with his demanding career.</p><p id=eXEOdQSZtZv data-wc=24>The relationship seems to be gathering momentum rapidly, with reports suggesting Taylor plans to attend the Chiefs’ upcoming match against the New York Jets.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/470e345ccdd5-gettyimages-1409999327.jpg><p id=e4JJaPbqP8H data-wc=18>Travis, in one of his recent podcasts, commented on Taylor's previous game appearance, labeling her decision as “ballsy”.&nbsp;</p><p id=er_JUoCv4kf data-wc=39>He seemed genuinely touched by her gesture, expressing gratitude towards those who spoke highly of her. “Shoutout to Taylor for coming through and seeing me rock the stage,” he said, playfully referring to his performance on the football field.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dnySbmxxZ6SWxq270WaqsKGWqXq0vM6tq56cXaGyosLIp55mrKKWw6q%2FjKScpZuVqHpyecyio6Whn6N6rK3NrJisZZOewbp5zJqlrKGfo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carla-sarkozy-style.html><span>←</span><span>Style chameleon Carla's in sync fashion tactics revealed</span></a>
