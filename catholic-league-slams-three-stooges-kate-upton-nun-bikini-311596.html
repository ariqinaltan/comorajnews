In a terse statement issued Thursday, Catholic League president Bill Donohue takes issue with a “nun bikini” and large rosary worn by swimsuit model Kate Upton in the slapstick comedy as well as with Larry David‘s character.
David, like Upton, plays a nun in Three Stooges, and his character’s name is Sister Mary-Mengele — named after infamous Nazi Josef Mengele."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Today it specializes in crudity and trashes Christianity, especially Catholicism,” Donohue said. “Enter The Three Stooges. The movie is not just another remake: It is a cultural marker of sociological significance, and what it says about the way we’ve changed is not encouraging.”</p><p>Fox disagreed that Three Stooges diverges from the original series. “The movie, in keeping with the spirit of the original TV show and its stars, is a broad, slapstick comedy,” a Fox spokesperson said.</p><p>“As the Stooges have proved over time, laughter is a universal medicine. The nuns that Mr. Donohue alludes to, are in fact, caring, heroic characters in the movie, albeit within the framework of a very broad comedy,” the spokesperson continued. “And as far as the nun attire, I think we did the audinece a favor by letting Kate Upton wear the nun-kini rather than Larry David — it could have gone either way. We invite you to see the movie and decide for yourselves.”</p><p>The Catholic League is the largest Catholic civil rights organization in the U.S.</p><p>Donohue also criticized comments made Wednesday night by David on TBS’&nbsp;Conan.</p><p>“He said to <strong>Conan O’Brien</strong> that dressing as a nun in the film makes it easy to understand why nuns are ‘so mean,’ ” Donohue said. “He explains: ‘You know, the outfits might have something to do with that. Forget about the fact that they never have sex. If you give me a chance of no sex or having to wear that outfit the rest of my life, I would definitely take the no sex.’ “</p><p>Donohue’s statement included the e-mail address of a top Fox executive.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKSt06GmpaGTYrmmrcaunGarnJa6tHnToamenV2owbC7xp6qZqORqbJuwc%2Btpqdlnqq7bq7IpKCnoV1ofnKBmG9m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-i-get-food-stamps-if-i-live-with-my-html.html><span>←</span><span>Can I Get Food Stamps If I Live With My Parents Washington State</span></a>
