He came off with an ankle injury and the next day wasn’t great, so we sent him for a scan. Again probably into the New Year for him.</p><p>“We’ve got a couple of suspensions as well, but Ben Davies is back and available. [Pedro] Porro is fine, he trained no problem.”</p><p>Tottenham confirmed Maddison had pulled out of the England squad on Friday morning in a statement that said: “We can confirm that James Maddison has been withdrawn from the England squad due to an ankle injury.</p><p>“The midfielder will not feature in the Three Lions’ <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>Uefa Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta</a> and <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>North Macedonia</a>, and will remain at Hotspur Way for rehabilitation with the Club’s medical staff.”</p><p>Maddison’s injury is a big problem for Postecoglou <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>with Van de Ven and Richarlison also injured</a>, and Cristian Romero and Destiny Udogie suspended.</p><p>Dutch international Van de Ven, who was signed in a deal worth £43 million from Wolfsburg in the summer, has been one of the standout performers in Tottenham’s excellent start to the season as has Maddison following his move from Leicester.</p><p>“Look, it is not just an opportunity for Gio (Lo Celso), it is Bryan Gil, we’ve got to be careful with [Rodrigo] Bentancur a bit, but it is for Skippy, for Eric Dier, all these guys,” Postecoglou added.</p><p>“This is why they have been training hard. Everything we’ve done is together and for all of them it is about when the opportunity comes. Fair to say the opportunity comes now.”</p><p>Eric Dier is likely to deputise for Van de Ven in the short term, but Tottenham are expected to now draw up a list of possible targets for the next transfer window – even allowing for van de Ven’s return from injury in the New Year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJ6fpMGjrculZmtoYmh8cn2OamdorJ%2Bpwaa6x5qkZqGen8KzxYybo6ivXay2tbSMo5imnaNiuqKww6KqqKZdlrusuMRmrqiqo5p8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-tragic-history-of-chinese-emperors.html><span>←</span><span>The Tragic History Of Chinese Emperors</span></a>
