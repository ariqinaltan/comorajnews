Greater Adelaide needs another 300,000 homes to meet demand by 2050 and there is one rising demographic driving the crisis: single-person households. The Greater Adelaide Regional Plan, which sketches a vision for sustainable development across South Australia’s population core, credits single-person households as the main reason housing demand now outstrips population growth, with the cohort increasing 78 per cent in the past 30 years."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
