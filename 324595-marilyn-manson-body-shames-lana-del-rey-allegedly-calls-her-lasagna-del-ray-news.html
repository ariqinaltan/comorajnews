Based on some leaked text messages of the rocker between him and an Instagram user known as Annie Abrams (initially confused for a True Blood actress, view her IG post on that below), he was a part of the fat-shaming mob that poked fun of songstress Lana Del Rey after she was captured by the paparazzi's camera.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/_/status/1288483457522442244</a><br></p><p>The "Summertime Sadness" crooner appeared to have gained a bit of weight during the COVID-19 quarantine, promoting many people, including Manson, to make fun of her build.&nbsp;<a href=# rel>Manson allegedly sent a photo</a> of Del Rey to Abrams before commenting on her appearance, prefacing his statements with "Not body shaming. Or whatever," before continuing, "But that pic is f**king crazy. It's like&nbsp;Vince Neil&nbsp;bad."</p><p>The metal singer continued his attack on Del Rey, dubbing the songstress&nbsp;"Lasagna Del Ray" to further ridicule her for her weight gain. He then&nbsp;<a href=# rel>explained his personal relationship</a> with the Grammy-nominated artist, explaining,&nbsp;"I know her. And my good friend was dating her and hilariously enough I did a photo shoot that they used her&nbsp;<a href=# rel>hair extensions dyed black</a> and I had an octopus on my head."&nbsp;He went&nbsp;on to&nbsp;claim in the messages, "She is really complicated. I'll leave it at that." &nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/p/CK5zM3FhGD9</a><br></p><p>As mentioned briefly before, Manson is currently facing allegations of abuse from his ex-fiancee Evan Rachel Wood, who&nbsp;<a href=# rel>outed the disgraced singer</a> for "grooming" and "horrifically" abusing her for years. Since then, numerous women have come forward with their own allegations against the singer.&nbsp;</p><p>Manson has&nbsp;<a href=# rel>denied the allegations</a> in an Instagram post, writing, "Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth."</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdjZ4F2hZRmpJqqmaHGr3nMmqWsp55ir7Cw2GaqoZmdmsBuuMCnmGaclaF6s7HYZpilpJWcsqW42GaamqScqHqpsdFmo5qrkZy7onnDnqNmqpGueq%2Bx1qw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-jackie-os-wild-logies-all-nighter.html><span>←</span><span>Logie Awards 2023: Jackie Os wild night at afterparty</span></a>
