Montana, a close friend of the late star, had said Mike had been in a "dark place" in the months before his death. PC Emma Clauson, who attended the scene, said she looked through the messages "which was a sort of combination of a diary and letters and positive thoughts". She also said: "At the back of the diary was a number of notes that had been addressed to his family." Toxicology results showed there was cocaine, ethanol and antidepressants in his system at the time of his death.</p><p id=e4dLC_wuDg3Z data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Caroline Flack responds to Love Island criticism following Mike Thalassitis' death</a></strong></p><p id=ezDgDNbJsOyq data-wc=129>Speaking after the hearing, Montana told reporters: "I don't really have too much to say, but what I will say is I think when someone dies in this way you don't give up on the memory and I think that a lot of people are scared to talk about it. But I think it's important to let his memory live on and remember the importance of why this happened, and to change your own life on what terrible, terrible thing has happened to Mike." She added: "I think everyone should be nicer, a little bit kinder - it's such an awful world we live in, it's just nice to be nice… I've definitely changed the way I live my life - and I urge others to do the same."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/72f9969e34ba-mike-love-island-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eZogK0AbAcXV data-wc=5><strong>Mike died in March 2019</strong></p><p id=e4yKEsZbaUyv data-wc=78>Mike's manager Dave Read read out a statement on behalf of his family, stating: "We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their kind messages and support during this very difficult time.
