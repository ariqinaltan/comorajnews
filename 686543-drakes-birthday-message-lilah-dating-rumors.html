He posted a photo of her alongside a sweet happy birthday message. "More life to the gyal that's impossible to duplicate," he begins. He goes on to call her "my inspo my confidant my best mate my heart." Off-and-on rumors that the pair were together began in 2022.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Lilah is also reported to be the woman pictured in the "Search & Rescue" cover art, who <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">fans rumored to be Kim Kardashian</a> earlier this year. Some fans speculated that the cover was an attempted shot at Kardashian's ex-husband, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kanye West</a>, amid their feud. However, it appears that Lilah is much more to Drake than just a Kim K look-alike. Earlier today, J Hus dropped a new track titled, "Who Told You," featuring Drake. Drake also seems to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">confess his feelings for Lilah</a> in the song, singing, "So Lilah Pi, don't make my eye cry." He also <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">gave fans a taste</a> of the new collab prior to it's release last night.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-wishes-lilah-a-happy-birthday>Drake Wishes Lilah A Happy Birthday</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier today, it was also revealed that Drake is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">nominated for seven BET awards. </a>He has the most nominations of all 2023 nominees, including Album Of The Year, Best Male R&B/Pop Artist, Best Male Hip Hop Artist, and more. Drake's upcoming summer 2023 tour with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>21 Savage</a> also begins later this month. The <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">It’s All A Blur&nbsp;tour</a>&nbsp;will include dates all around the U.S., making notable stops at Madison Square Garden, Kia Forum, and more.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of Drake's other notable relationships, his bromance with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Yachty</a>, also went on full display recently. Earlier this week, Drake <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">encouraged Kick to give his friend a streaming deal</a> during a livestream. “Yo, listen! I don’t know who owns Kick, but I’m just saying… You know, you guys, I know the chat wants to see Yachty go live. I’ve been telling him, I feel like he could take over Kick," he told the platform. "There’s a little business idea for you guys, whoever’s responsible for writing the checks. You see the chat’s going crazy for my brother.”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Caroline Fisher is a News Writer at HotNewHipHop from Chicago, Illinois.
