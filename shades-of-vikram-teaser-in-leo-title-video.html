Later he tastes the chocolate and says, ‘Bloody Sweet’. No doubt, the video is powerful as in the end it is revealed that the title is “Leo”. However, isn’t this video exactly like Kamal Haasan’s Vikram title reveal video?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>While the visuals may be different, the concepts are similar where in the old one, Kamal waits for a gang of goons and others to come for a dinner, and while everyone leaves their weapons behind, he will have his under the table. With so many expectations on Lokesh Kanagaraj, fans are feeling that this comparison is a little thing to worry about as long as the director mesmerises with his screenplay.</p><p>On the other hand, after watching Vijay as a stunner in “Master” movie, his fans are expecting that Lokesh will now deliver something bigger than “Vikram” with Ilayathalapathy. And they have announced the film in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and Kannada as well.</p><p class=post-tag>Tags <a href=# rel=tag>Leo Teaser</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Vijay Leo</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Vikram Leo</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qMHLrZxnm5%2BifK671aKcp52nqHxzfpVwbXFno52upbHSZqafZaaeuLOtzGarnpmjmr9utc1mo56nXam2tbjEZq2inJWk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rachel-brosnahan-oscar-isaac-broadway-1235503639.html><span>←</span><span>Rachel Brosnahan on &amp;quot;Unapologetically Curious&amp;quot; Broadway Co-Star Oscar Isaac</span></a>
