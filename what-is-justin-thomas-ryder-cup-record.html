The first of those began well for him when he and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/jordan-spieth>Jordan Spieth</a> struck what would become a familiar partnership to beat <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/paul-casey>Paul Casey</a> and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/tyrrell-hatton>Tyrrell Hatton</a> in the Friday morning fourballs.&nbsp;</p><p>However, that joy was short-lived for the pair. In the afternoon foursomes they were defeated 5&4 by <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/francesco-molinari>Francesco Molinari</a> and Tommy <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/tommy-fleetwood>Fleetwood</a> in a dominant session for the Europeans.</p><p>Undeterred, the duo returned on Saturday morning to beat <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/ian-poulter>Ian Poulter</a> and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/jon-rahm>Jon Rahm</a> 2&1 in the fourballs before claiming another win in the afternoon foursomes against Poulter and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/rory-mcilroy>Rory McIlroy</a>.</p><p>Thomas once again got the better of McIlroy in the Sunday singles to leave him with a hugely impressive 4–1–0 record in a match that was otherwise disappointing for Team USA as it lost by 17.5 to 10.5 points at France’s <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/ryder-cup/ryder-cup-news/le-golf-national-162596>Le Golf National</a>.</p><p>After qualifying automatically for the 2021 edition at Whistling Straits, Thomas and Spieth resumed their partnership for the Friday fourballs, but this time they came up short, with Rahm and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/sergio-garcia>Sergio Garcia</a> winning 3&1.</p><p>There was an improvement in the afternoon, when Spieth and Thomas halved their fourballs match with Fleetwood and Viktor Hovland, and on Saturday it got even better as the pair finished 2up over Hovland and Bernd Weisberger in the morning foursomes.</p><p>Once again, Thomas claimed victory in his Sunday singles match, this time 4&3 against Tyrrell Hatton, leaving him with another solid record for his efforts, of 2-1-1.</p><p>Combined, Thomas’ Ryder Cup record stands at 6-2-1, so it’s hardly surprising there has been a clamour for his involvement in 2023, particularly as his trusty playing partner, Spieth, will likely make the team too.&nbsp;</p><p>For further evidence of Thomas' suitability to the format, you only need to look at his Presidents Cup record, which stands at 10-3-2.</p><p>The most impressive of his those three appearances came in 2022 where he finished 4-1-0. Once again, he did that with the help of Spieth, proving that when the two friends come together, it more often than not brings success.</p><p>Thomas may have some work to do to regain his best form on the PGA Tour, but where it comes to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/golf-rules/match-play-golf-rules-explained-221131>match play</a>, he’s up there with some of the best. Johnson will hope he repays the faith he has put in him for the encounter in Rome. Given Thomas’ Ryder Cup record so far, he’ll have every confidence it will happen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvLn6SopqSdubp6wqikaKaVrMBww8eaq2aho2K3tr%2FToqVmrJikuqK%2FjKuwnZ2iYrC2vIyrnJynopk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-hotels-are-near-seaworld-san-diego-html.html><span>←</span><span>What Hotels Are Near Seaworld San Diego</span></a>
