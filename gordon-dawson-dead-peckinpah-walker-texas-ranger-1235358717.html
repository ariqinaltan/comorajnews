When the extras’ costumes did not match the ones Dawson had prepared, Peckinpah shut down production on the first day of shooting.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Dawson was summoned to the set in&nbsp;Mexico to age the other costumes, noting in the 1993 documentary&nbsp;Sam Peckinpah: Man of Iron&nbsp;that he was “terrified” to meet the intimidating director. He needn’t have worried, though; Dawson fixed the other costumes, filming resumed, and a friendship was born.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Dawson was asked by Peckinpah to serve as wardrobe supervisor on The&nbsp;Wild Bunch (1969), but he hesitated because he had become a screenwriter. However, he did take the job and went on to collaborate with the filmmaker as a writer and associate producer on The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970); as an associate producer and second-unit director on The Getaway (1972) and Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (1973); and as writer and associate producer on Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He also showed up onscreen in The Wild Bunch&nbsp;and Pat Garrett.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Born in Pasadena in 1938, Dawson did some acting as a child, then joined the U.S. Army at age 17 as a marksman and sharpshooter.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">After an honorable discharge, he worked as a firefighter and then in the costume department on films including All the Young Men (1960), The Mountain Road (1960), Experiment in Terror (1962), Cat Ballou&nbsp;(1965) and Garner’s Hour of the Gun (1967) and on the 1965-66 NBC series Branded.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Dawson&nbsp;began his writing career in 1968 on ABC’s&nbsp;Cowboy in Africa, and he would also pen episodes of Bonanza, Black Sheep Squadron, Lou Grant, Sons of Thunder, Baywatch Nights, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Silk Stalkings and Diagnosis Murder.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He wrote nine installments of&nbsp;The Rockford Files from 1975-79 and was a writer and supervising producer on another <a href=# id=auto-tag_james-garner data-tag=james-garner>James Garner</a> NBC starrer, Bret Maverick, during its lone 1981-82 season. &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">His last television series,&nbsp;as a writer, supervising producer and co-executive producer, was CBS’&nbsp;Walker, Texas Ranger.&nbsp;He wrote 32 episodes of the <a href=# id=auto-tag_chuck-norris data-tag=chuck-norris>Chuck Norris</a>-led show during its 1993-2001 run.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In 2000, he was nominated for a WGA award for his work on the TNT telefilm Purgatory.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“He was the nicest person I ever met in the movie business,” said longtime friend and actor Chester Grimes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Survivors include his son, Michael; daughter-in-law Kathleen; grandchildren Tyler and Ashley; and brothers Thomas and Peter.
