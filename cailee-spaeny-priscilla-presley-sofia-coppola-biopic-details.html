Entitled Priscilla, the A24 film isn't out until October, but fans got to see the very first glimpse of actress Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla (opposite Jacob Elordi as Elvis) in the first trailer released Wednesday."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
