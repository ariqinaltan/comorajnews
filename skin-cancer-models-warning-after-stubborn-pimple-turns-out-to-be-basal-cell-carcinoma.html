Italian model Valentina Ferragni has opened up about her “terrifying” skin cancer diagnosis after scratching off what she thought was a pimple.
Ferragni, 30, revealed that the spot on her forehead, which had lingered there for a year, turned out to be skin cancer. She had it removed straight away as well as a chunk of possibly cancerous flesh beneath it, reports the Daily Mail UK."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It showed melanoma caused 57,000 deaths worldwide in 2020, but non-melanoma skin cancer caused even more, with 63,700 people losing their lives to the disease.</p><p>The Cancer Society in New Zealand recommends checking your skin regularly, including areas that aren’t normally exposed to the sun. To protect your skin from sun damage, wear a hat, <a href=#>use sunscreen with at least SPF 30</a>, wear sunglasses and clothing that covers as much skin as possible, and stay in the shade.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmpaGWmsC1xcueZqyjmaN6pK3NnJyrZZ2ksaa40maumqqenruoecCfq56qXajBtq7BqKmnZaCeurG4xGarrqqeqHqwwdNmq6hlkpp6o63SmqNmm5WhuW6vwKuaoqafoq5wkreNbH17d4OYm42SbnmQkH16mXOUoY6LjHlf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1407561-sasha-czack-biography-who-sylvester-stallones-wife-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sasha Czack biography: Who is Sylvester Stallone's first wife?</span></a>
