It left a lasting impression on us heading into this year and it is a reason why we think he is ready to take the next step. He is starting off 2024 with the lead single to his rumored next album, Scarecrow. "Dreidel Bop" sticks to the current formula that got fans engaged in his previous works. The song is not reinventing the wheel, but it does its job as a solid banger.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on this brand-new single, "Dreidel Bop," by BLP KOSHER?
