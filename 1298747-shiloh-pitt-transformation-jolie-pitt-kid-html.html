She was born on May 27, 2006, in Swakopmund, Namibia. She is 13 years old. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt opted to deliver in Namibia to ensure the privacy and protection of their first biological kid.</p><p class=align-left>The decision was also partially influenced by Angelina's love for Namibia's epic countryside where she spent some time as a UN refugee ambassador. The Brangelina couple sold Shiloh's first pictures through Getty images to <i>People magazine</i> for $4.1 million and to <i>Hello! </i>magazine at $3.5 million. The couple<i> </i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">donated the proceeds</a> to charity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7b9dc453576be381.jpg><h2>Shiloh Pitt transformation</h2><p class=align-left>As a baby, her blonde hair and blue eyes were her distinguishing features.
