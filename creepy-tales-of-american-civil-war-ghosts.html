Carmichael took a position there, and she was, to put it mildly, not a very nice person. Tales of abuse started to get out, and by 1876, she was arrested for cruelty. But, the good old days being what they were, she was found guilty but only had to pay a fine and was then back at her post. Her abuse, it was said, grew worse: Children were subjected to beatings, they were locked in the outhouses on freezing cold nights, they were shackled in the basement, and those chains and shackles? They're still there.&nbsp;</p><p>It's no wonder, then, that the spirits of the children are still there, too. Visitors to the site — now the <a href=#>National Soldiers' Orphans' Homestead</a>&nbsp;– have reported seeing apparitions of dirty, disheveled children and hearing the sound of children giggling when there are none about. Others describe a feeling of extreme sadness that weighs upon the shoulders when going into the basement. Remnants of the emotions of distraught children, or simply empathy?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BkXJqcm1fmL%2Bmsc%2ByZK2ZnJrAbrvFZpimnaKesKK6jJygr6GcYsSivoygn6irpKh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cameron-diaz-benji-madden-engaged.html><span>←</span><span>Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden 'engaged after seven months'</span></a>
