While we will always do our best to rescue as many clothes from landfill as we can through our vintage collections, we found increasingly that we were there amazing pieces and beautiful materials that we couldn’t sell due to their condition but could create something out of them."</p><img alt="a person wearing clothes" title="Vintage Threads" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vintage-threads-65799e7bcd51a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Vintage Threads</span><p>A Fendi trench coat reworked into a two-piece</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Reworking is all about minimising as much newness as possible, without sacrificing style, he explains. "It offers a fantastic option to further reduce how many clothes we are sending to landfill every year. It’s also a great challenge to brands around the world to look at their landfill waste and ask themselves if they can find other ways to use materials, as this needs to become the last possible option for clothing and, eventually, not an option at all."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it comes to sustainable fashion more generally, transparency is key to moving the industry forward, Rose argues. With that in mind, brands need to take responsibility and be honest with themselves about the impact their marketing is having on consumers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The fashion industry is already making some positive changes and bringing about a more conscious mindset, however, there is always a risk of greenwashing. There needs to be greater transparency with what brands are doing with their surplus stock. Brands need to take a lot more responsibility for how they are driving over-consumption among consumers and driving the mindset of always needing new clothes."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And, although there is an onus on brands, the real change comes from the top. "I’d love to see government intervention as it’s an issue that isn’t simply going to go away," he says."Huge changes need to be made at the top level to ensure change happens at the rate it needs to."</p><img alt="a group of dresses on display" title="Vintage threads " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-5928-65799eb57a6a9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Vintage Threads</span><p>Vintage Threads inside Selfridges</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rose cites the French government as leading by example. They recently introduced a repair bonus scheme (through which customers can claim money back on their clothing repairs), and he is hoping that something similar will take place here in the UK too. But, of course, big change only happens with external pressure, so the power begins with us shoppers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There has never been a better time to be an eco-conscious shopper," he says. "I would advise consumers to challenge themselves if they need a piece of clothing. Perhaps they could repair an element of it or rework it to achieve that feeling of newness. A more circular fashion model has to be an ambition among all of us."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What’s next for Vintage Threads? "From a day-to-day perspective, our ambition is always to get better every day, to keep changing perceptions of vintage and reworked clothing, to help drive the fashion industry to a more sustainable and circular model. We’d love to have Vintage Threads stores in the top 10 major cities worldwide, we know it’s ambitious, but if we can maintain the same customer experience we have now, then we have a lot to offer in cities around the world."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Vintage Threads – which has made pieces for the likes of Adriana Grande and Emma Chamberlain – has its own store in London's Covent Garden, and has recently opened up a concession in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/features/project-earth/how-to-shop-preloved-fashion/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Selfridges, which you can visit now." data-vars-ga-product-id=a10e7392-0056-40d0-8f38-3e2733351153 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/features/project-earth/how-to-shop-preloved-fashion/ data-product-url=https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/features/project-earth/how-to-shop-preloved-fashion/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2FGB%2Fen%2Ffeatures%2Fproject-earth%2Fhow-to-shop-preloved-fashion%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=8aa3e781-66f2-4177-b47e-7e610581bafa class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Selfridges, which you can visit now.</a></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmTEqa3TZquoZaearrN7wG1sb3BiaH91e9Wipa2Zl5p6tbTRnpidq12nsrGtyKtkrJ2iq7aksY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./trish-penix-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Trish Penix Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
