But there are all kinds of creative subgenres to explore, as Shae Gines demonstrates! Bridal boudoir is something we wish we saw more of since wedding dresses can be much more than traditional symbols of matrimony.</p><p>Wedding dresses, cowgirl outfits, and any other apparel you have in mind can easily fit into one of Shae’s themed boudoir shoots. However, she also shoots more traditional boudoir using a style that’s well balanced between highlights and shadows. Rather than the high contrast, highly moody style that’s popular in today’s boudoir world, Shae uses a balanced approach to lighting that emphasizes form and composition over strong tonality to set the mood of the scene.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Crystal Visions Boudoir is a Salt Lake City studio that has perfected mood lighting in boudoir. Just the right amount of shadow to be believable yet precisely enough mid-tones and highlights to not leave you guessing. Their colors are highly realistic with an occasional matte or monochrome profile added for a vintage flavor. Coupled with their talent for up close and intimate poses and you have a winning formula for any lover of this genre.</p><p>We also love to see “dudoir” in the portfolio of any boudoir photographer. Men can be just as conflicted about their bodies as women in different ways. And a photographer with the talent to photograph both women and men in a flattering yet intimate spotlight is definitely one of the top Salt Lake City boudoir photographers.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.instagram.com/vintagelaceboudoir/</a></p><p>Studio boudoir photography has a lot to offer. Well-controlled lighting, prop collections, and a professional atmosphere all help clients look their very best. Vintage Lace Boudoir, operated by Avion, has been a photographer for over 15 years.</p><p>In the past few years, her work has evolved towards the specialized, creative, celebratory genre of boudoir images. And we’re thrilled she’s taken that turn in her creative career! Avion seeks to, in her own words, capture the intrinsic beauty of a person. Given the highly individual nature of her boudoir images, we think she’s succeeded masterfully.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>A lot of prospective boudoir clients feel that this is something they might be able to do “someday.” That once they work off a few flaws they will be worthy of camera-time. We love that Ember & Ash Boudoir dispels this notion right away! As Emily shouts to the world: ” My goal is for every person to understand that self-love is not a “someday” but a “right now!” You are already worthy, valuable, and ravishingly beautiful.”</p><p>It helps to have such a motivated, loving eye when it comes to doing boudoir. Her way of showcasing various body types, complexions, and personalities is unmatched in the boudoir world. Emily works with people from all walks of life, helping to remind you and others on the fence that boudoir is a celebration of yourself, first and foremost. It can be a gift and a healing experience as well, with the right mindset.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbHEq6qpmZOae6S7zGipnqufqr%2BksdJomaitlKS2s3nPoaatp5enrrG0xKuqZquRocFuuMCknGabmanGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./821123-tech-n9ne-the-birth-stream.html><span>←</span><span>Tech N9ne Goes Back To Where It All Began On The Birth</span></a>
