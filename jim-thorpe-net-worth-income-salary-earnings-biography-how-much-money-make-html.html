He is regarded as one of the most versatile athletes in contemporary sports, having won Olympic gold medals in the pentathlon and decathlon in 1912, as well as playing American football (collegiate and professional), baseball, and basketball at the highest levels. He was stripped of his Olympic gold medals when it was discovered that he had been paid for playing two seasons of semi-professional baseball prior to participating in the Olympics, in violation of the amateurism regulations in effect at the time. 30 years after his death, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) returned his Olympic medals, which he had won in Los Angeles. Thorpe grew raised in the Sac and Fox Nation, which is located in the state of Oklahoma. Throughout his career, he was a member of many All-American Indian teams, and he even “barnstormed” as a professional basketball player with a team made up exclusively of American Indians. During the years 1920 to 1921, Thorpe served as the nominal president of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which would eventually become the National Football League (NFL) the following year. He continued to play professional sports until he was 41 years old, with the end of his sporting career coinciding with the beginning of the Great Depression. Thorpe struggled to make a living after that, taking on a variety of&nbsp;</span><span>occupations to supplement his income. Thorpe struggled with drinking and spent his last years in poor health and destitution as a result. When ABC Sports asked sports fans to vote, Thorpe was chosen as the greatest athlete of the twentieth century, beating out 15 other sportsmen such as Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Jesse Owens. Wayne Gretzky, Jack Nicklaus, and Michael Jordan were all among those who were voted.</span><h2>Jim Thorpe&nbsp;Net Worth : $ 15 Million</h2><p>Lets check out updated 2021 Jim Thorpe Net Worth Income Salary report which is given below :</p><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><b>Jim Thorpe’s Salary /&nbsp;</b></span><b>Income</b><b>:</b><p><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Year:</b>&nbsp;$ 4,00,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Month:</b>&nbsp;$ 32,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Week:</b>&nbsp;$ 8,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><br></span></span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><table><tbody><tr><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Day:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Hour:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Minute:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Second:</span></b></td></tr><tr><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 1140</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 19</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 0.3</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 0.05</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Jim Thorpe Wiki</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jim Thorpe</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 22, 1887</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>March 28, 1953, Lomita, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Prague, Indian Territory [now Oklahoma], USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.85&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>92&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Sailor, Baseball player, American football player</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Jim Thorpe FAQ</h2><ul><li>How did Jim Thorpe get so rich?</li><li>What is Jim Thorpe Earning per day ?</li><li>Lets check out Jim Thorpe Wife / Husand Net Worth ?</li><li>How much does Jim Thorpe make per day?</li><li>How much Jim Thorpe Net Worth ?</li><li>How Jim Thorpe become rich ?</li><li>How does Jim Thorpe make money ?</li><li>What is Jim Thorpe Income ?</li><li>How much Jim Thorpe Salary ?</li><li>How old is Jim Thorpe Age ?</li><li>How tall is Jim Thorpe Height ?</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZnxyfI6joKZlpJ28s7zEZqWerF2svLPAx2agp5uforJuv8ClmKuxXZqus7rIp56sZZKevKi%2BwKmfsmWYpMRuudScn2aln6OyunnMmqKeZpipuq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jane-wyatt-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Jane Wyatt Net Worth 2024</span></a>
