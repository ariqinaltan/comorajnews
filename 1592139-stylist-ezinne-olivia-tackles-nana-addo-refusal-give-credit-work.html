See some of the comments below:</p><p class=align-left>@ladywith9lives:</p>"What do you expect of someone wearing "double-face"? To be fair and honest?"<p class=align-left>@attih_soul:</p>"So, because I got paid, I should sit back and watch someone else take credit for my hardwork? Either you tag the real designer or you don't tag anyone at all. People screaming that she's entitled are just as vile as the offender."<p class=align-left>@amazingdoyin:</p>"I feel like ₦400,000 was a cheap pay off for you not to be tagged to a dress worn to such a massive event as the AMVCA. The issue here is someone else getting tagged like they were the ones who made it. It'll be downright infuriating to the designer. Wisdom is key."<p class=align-left>@naija_rich_kids:</p>"For nothing how? The agreement was followed.
