Video of Fonda’s most recent arrest was <a href=# rel=nofollow>posted</a> on social media. She is shown cuffed, clearly enjoying the moment.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress, who will turn 82 on Saturday, has avoided arrest in the past few weeks as, by law, accumulating so many run-ins with the law would trigger lengthier jail stints.&nbsp;</p><p>A political activist for decades, Fonda has made it clear she intends to get arrested as many times as it takes to get her point across.</p><p>“I will be on the Capitol every Friday, rain or shine, inspired and emboldened by the incredible movement our youth have created,” Fonda previously wrote on her own website.</p><p>D.C. authorities previously confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that Fonda would not be charged for her prior arrests. It is unclear if she will be charged now. She did spend one night in jail following one of those initial arrests.&nbsp;</p><p>Others arrested in the past while protesting with Fonda include Sally Field, Ted Danson,&nbsp;Rosanna Arquette, Catherine Keener and&nbsp;Sam Waterston.&nbsp;</p><p>As in the past, the arrested protesters will likely be charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKutzZ5kn6eema5urdGrnKyslZl6p7XFrZ9mrJmism680airnquknruoedaaqqGhnpzBsLqMamlvbGRug3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./long-lasting-liquid-lipstick-review-7486253.html><span>←</span><span>Ive Tested Hundreds of Lipsticks and I Found the Best Long-Lasting Picks</span></a>
