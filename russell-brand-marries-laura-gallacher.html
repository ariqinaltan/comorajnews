Russell, 42, revealed all about the big day on his Radio X podcast, telling viewers that he was now a "domestic." He said: "I'm living a married life now…I'm domestic." Celebrity guests in attendance included Laura's older sister, Kirsty Gallacher, along with the likes of <span><strong>Jonathan Ross</strong></span>, <a class=hm-link href=#>Noel Gallagher</a> and <strong>David Baddiel</strong>.</p><p id=erBiOlZF5JtV data-wc=77>The couple's nine-month-old daughter Mabel was also present, with a source telling The Sun: "They wanted a very small, personal&nbsp;affair with their daughter Mabel, family and close friends rather than&nbsp;a circus. It was a lovely occasion. Mabel was guest of honour," According to the paper, Russell spent £2,300 to hire the New Orleans steamer so that guests could travel in style back to an Indian-themed wedding reception close to the couple's home in Henley-on-Thames, Oxford.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cc3156edce4f-brand-z.jpg><p id=eu_uIKDAorfd data-wc=11><strong>Russell Brand&nbsp;spoke about married life on his Radio X&nbsp;podcast&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e-BFsg12MTor data-wc=54>Back in June, <a class=hm-link href=#>Laura enjoyed a fun-filled hen party</a> ahead of her wedding, where she was joined by her mum Lesley and famous sister Kirsty.

The couple&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>welcomed their daughter Mabel&nbsp;in November 2016</a>. Russell, who was previously married to <a class=hm-link href=#>Katy Perry</a>, recently opened up about&nbsp;becoming a first-time father, telling John Bishop: "When she was born, I felt something really quite profound. I felt extremely present in that birth, completely overwhelmed by it. I've heard a lot of men say, 'I didn't know I had so much love in me', but I did know I had so much love in me. I just didn't know what to do with it. And when I saw her, I felt something switch on – this sense of very determined and clear purpose."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQcGdxamdpfnp%2Fk2iprqujmrmtecGrmKecXaKus77InqpmpJGqv6J5xpqjpZmTnbKzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rita-ora-meets-meryl-streep-pre-oscars.html><span>←</span><span>Rita Ora on meeting Meryl Streep: 'My life is complete'</span></a>
