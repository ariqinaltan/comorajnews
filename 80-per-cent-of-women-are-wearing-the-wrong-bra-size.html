No matter what size you are, the centre of the bra should always sit flat to your ribcage and if the straps are falling down, you might need a bra with adjustable straps.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Why so many of us are getting it wrong</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>"</strong>Some women wear band sizes that are too big due to feeling it should be loose for comfort—but 80 per cent of support comes from the band so a bra should fit snug and still feel comfortable at the same time," says Solak.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you have a gap in your cup it's easy to mistake this as being a size too big, but in some instances you could just be wearing the wrong cup shape - not all bra styles were made to fit all breasts. Solak also advises against wearing a size too small to gain more cleavage, as this isn't providing proper support. "If a cup is too small then the bra's wire sits on the breast tissue which may cause discomfort and not support you properly. We would recommend trying different bra silhouettes to find a frame that suits you best."</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">How to make sure you're wearing the right one</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Solak recommends that that you should have a fitting every six months, as "your body is always changing". To make sure that your bras offer you the best support between these fittings, it's really important to take care of them when washing so they stay in shape. "The best thing to do is hand-wash all bras and then dry them on a flat surface," she explains. "Bras should be interchanged every day or two so that they keep their elasticity and don't wear out too quickly." She recommends that once you find the perfect-fitting bra that you love, you should have three on hand - one to wear, one to wash and one to rest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, Victoria's Secret Angel Romee Strijd, face of the Bra Fit campaign, shares her health, fitness and beauty tips.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Romee Strijd shares her health and fitness advice" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/777bf5b4-e802-49ff-b04a-004f0c2a4dbd/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1535823264_9440.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wGtqaW5iZ4Z1e5dpZKmdomKwprrTZqafZaekuqa6jJqpnmWnmq6ztc2gZK2glWLEs7vNoGSbqpFiwKrGxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8-things-you-didnt-know-about-vernon-adkison-html.html><span>←</span><span>8 Things You Didnt Know about Vernon Adkison</span></a>
