However, new information appears to indicate that the situation was much more serious and was a true life-or-death situation for Foxx.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-foxx-revived-on-set-after-stroke>Foxx Revived On Set After Stroke</h2></span><p>According to sources who spoke to Radar Online, Foxx needed to be resuscitated after suffering his stroke. “Jamie suffered a serious medical episode and needed immediate attention,” the source said. “It was touch and go for days with him, and he had to be revived — he is very lucky to be alive!” the source said. It is unclear if the resuscitation happened on set or during his stay in the hospital. However, a stroke is a very serious medical event that can often have unforeseen complications after the initial incident. However, we cannot fully speculate on the specifics.</p><p>Additionally, the source also reportedly revealed the cause behind the stroke. “He’s very lucky he got the treatment he did,” they continued. “Jamie suffers from high blood pressure, which doctors say can cause clots in the brain, leading to a stroke. Doctors believe this was a long time coming, and really, if they hadn’t acted fast, Jamie might well have been a goner.” This means that the stroke was seemingly more severe than previously reported and had Foxx in critical condition at one point. However, it appears that the immediate danger has passed and that Foxx is on the mend. It remains unclear as to when Foxx will leave the hospital, or return to work. Regardless, the entertainment industry will be happy to hear he is on the mend despite a very scary moment a few weeks ago.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdma4N6hJJmoZqlmZp6p7vXsWSsrKKkuKZ5wJ2boqyZpLuiuIydnK2ZmaHA</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-gandolfini-net-worth-at-death.html><span>←</span><span>James Gandolfini Net Worth At Death</span></a>
