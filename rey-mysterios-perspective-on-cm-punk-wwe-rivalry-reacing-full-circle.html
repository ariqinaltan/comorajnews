During that time, he had an extensive feud with CM Punk. Now, Mysterio has commented on a full-circle moment as Punk recently wrestled his son Dominik Mysterio.</p><p>The world eagerly waited for CM Punk’s return to the <a href=#>WWE ring after decade at Madison Square Garden</a>. For his comeback match, Punk faced Dominik Mysterio, undoubtedly a fitting choice for Punk’s first bout back.</p><p>CM Punk initially encountered a young Dominik when the latter appeared alongside his father during a WWE angle. During Punk’s Straight Edge Society days, he had a feud with Rey Mysterio. As noted already, Punk’s WWE return match was against a now grown-up Dominik.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>Keepin’ It 100</a>, Rey Mysterio acknowledged his&nbsp;feud with CM Punk and talked about how young his children were when he was feuding with CM Punk, way back in 2010.</p><p>“Of course, Punk was a big rival during the whole Mysterio family on board in WWE, you know, with my daughter’s birthday. I don’t know; she was six or seven years old at the time, Dom was 13, 14? It’s kind of cool to revisit all of that. And now to see the growth, overall, of just the Mysterio family, and how we’re all still connected in some way.”</p><p>Rey Mysterio’s in-ring <a href=#>return date after surgery was also revealed</a>. We will have to wait and see whether The Master of The 619 and CM Punk will have an interaction next year, as fans would love that.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your opinion on what Rey Mysterio had to say?
