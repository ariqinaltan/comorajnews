He stars in the 6-episode&nbsp;documentary alongside his eldest son, Nasir.&nbsp;The trailer for the show was posted on social media on November 16, 2023, and immediately popped off.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Alicia Keys Talks Making Blended Family Work By Bonding With Swizz Beatz's Ex-Wife</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-nasir-dean-23>Prince Nasir Dean (23)</h2></span><p>Born on October 25, 2000, Prince Nasir Dean is the first of five kids by Swizz Beatz.&nbsp;Nasir&nbsp;was conceived from a previous relationship Swizz Beatz had with Nicole Levy in the late ‘90s. Through various social media posts over the years, the public has gotten to witness the producer’s love for&nbsp;his son. Following in the steps of his father, the 23-year-old is now a rapper, producer, and DJ, going by the name “Note Marcato.” Nasir&nbsp;went viral back in 2020 for attending the Grammys with the skeleton face paint that became Note Marcato’s signature look. As aforementioned, he also stars beside his dad in the new Hulu show&nbsp;Drive with Swizz Beatz. All six episodes are now available on the streaming service.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kasseem-dean-jr-16>Kasseem Dean Jr. (16)</h2></span><p>In 2006,&nbsp;Swizz Beatz welcomed his&nbsp;second child and namesake, Kasseem Dean Jr.,&nbsp;with Mashonda Tifrere.&nbsp;Prior to Dean Jr.’s birth on December 22, 2006, Swizz Beatz and Tifrere had wed in 2004. While the two separated in 2008, they have&nbsp;maintained&nbsp;an amicable co-parenting relationship.&nbsp;Unlike his older brother, Dean Jr. seems to be taking a different route from music. He is a budding track and field star with a clear interest in fashion, and his father doesn’t hesitate to express his pride and love for him. Swizz Beatz is famous for openly celebrating his kids, and Dean Jr. is no exception.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicole-dean-15>Nicole Dean (15)</h2></span><p>Of his five kids, Nicole Dean is the only daughter Swizz Beatz has, and she was conceived by Jahna Sabastian. Nicole was born on May 22, 2008, but it wasn’t until a year later that Swizz Beatz found out about her.&nbsp;Subsequently, he stepped into his role as her father. Over a decade into her life now, Nicole has grown up spending a lot of time with her father and siblings. Never one to withhold love from his family, Swizz Beatz has showered Nicole with it over the years.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-egypt-daoud-dean-13>Egypt Daoud Dean (13)</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 07: (L-R) Swizz Beatz, Egypt Daoud Dean and Alicia Keys attend the 10th annual Keep A Child Alive Black Ball at Hammerstein Ballroom on November 7, 2013 in New York City.

Egypt Daoud is their first,&nbsp;and he was born on October 14, 2010, months after his parents married.&nbsp;In general, it would usually be too early to say what career path he would end up on. However,&nbsp;he has shared that he wants to be a basketball player.&nbsp;Despite his statement, <a href=# rel>Egypt has&nbsp;displayed an impressive affinity for music</a>&nbsp;as well, taking after both his parents. He wrote his first song at the age of six. Additionally, he received production credits on <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kendrick Lamar</a>’s 2016 compilation album,&nbsp;Untitled&nbsp;Unmastered. Evidently, he’s a very gifted 13-year-old.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Swizz Beatz Says His Son Helped Kendrick Lamar Overcome Writer’s Block</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-genesis-ali-dean-8>Genesis Ali Dean (8)</h2></span><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 26: Swizz Beatz and Genesis Ali Dean during the 62nd Annual GRAMMY Awards at STAPLES Center on January 26, 2020 in Los Angeles, California.

He was born on December 27, 2014. According to Keys in her autobiographical book, More Myself, his pregnancy was a surprise, and came at “the worst time ever.” Nonetheless, Keys and Beatz prepared for and welcomed him wholeheartedly. Now only 8 years old, Genesis has his whole life ahead of him. At the very least, he can rest easy, knowing he has very loving parents.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnaIR0gZRmqrChqq96o7HArbFmo5mZwA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-long-does-it-take-for-a-pond-to-freeze-4-inches.html><span>←</span><span>How long does it take for a pond to freeze 4 inches?</span></a>
