After the match was over, Shayna Baszler had enough. She blamed their losses on Reginald, but then Nia Jax looked as if she was going to defend him. Instead of coddling Reggie again, she knocked him down.</p><p>Baszler and Jax left on their own, firing Reginald in the process. Then Akira Tozawa ran down and a new opportunity opened up. Reggie heard a smattering of “Reggie Sucks” chants from fans, but he turned that around after pinning Tozawa to become the 24/7 Champion.</p><p>Now Reginald is the WWE 24/7 Champion. He celebrated by doing backflips down the ramp to leave.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
