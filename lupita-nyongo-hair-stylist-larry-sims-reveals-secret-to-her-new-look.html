She really inspires women across the world to embrace the natural texture."</p><p id=eHHF_ex66Hov data-wc=65>The actress debuted her new hairdo at the Anaheim convention centre, and posted several snaps on Instagram. While Lupita didn't comment on her new haircut, Larry revealed the decision for the change came from both of them. "<strong>This idea was a collaboration between Lupita and me</strong>," he adds. "She took my vision and we bounced ideas off of each other to get the perfect look."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=ew4tYpS6_9fb data-wc=16><strong>Larry has worked with a host of stars – including Tracee Ellis Ross and Kerry Washington</strong></p><p id=exa_y_cgCTLD data-wc=25>When it came to creating her new look, Larry revealed there was one product he used to "showcase the growth and wave" of her hair.</p><p id=ePto55uOhv3U data-wc=49>"Lupita is growing out her natural hair so we wanted to showcase the growth and wave," he said.

Lupita, along with her new 'do, headed over to Splash Mountain after the expo to take a spin on the Wet and Wild ride, in what marked her first trip to Disneyland.
