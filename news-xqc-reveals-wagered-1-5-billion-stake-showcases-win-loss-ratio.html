The viewer asserted that the streamer was "unfathomably lucky" during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>his gambling spins</a>. They said:</p>"I wrote down statistics. You and Buddha, like, Buddha was saying he has never got a single, like, five scatter out of the 30 buys that he did. And every single one of your buys was either a five or six scatter. First off, just that luck, is like, unfathomably lucky. Then, back-to-back, like, $100,000, $200,000, $100,000, $114,000 - I wrote down all the exact numbers, let me you show the graph. And, it's just like, so unfathomably lucky to a point where this is so unrealistic."<p>In response, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>xQc claimed</a> that the fan did not have "a lot of knowledge" about how gambling works. He remarked:</p>"No, you're right. The problem is that, I think you don't have a lot of knowledge, since you're not the one who... I hate to trivialize your 'stats' or whatever. You don't sound like you gamble a lot. Or you've done it a lot. Right? It's a little bit unfortunate that's the way it is, right?"<p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>former Overwatch pro</a> then elaborated on his observations of how online gambling works based on his own experience:</p>"The way seeds are done or generated on the machines is f**king boring as s**t! Let me explain you why. I mean, from my experience, I think everybody admitted, that gambles kind of knows this. Whenever games start acting in a certain way, right, it'll be bricked like that, for like, a good amount of f**king time. So, we're talking, like - I'm doing buy-ins and s**t like that, right? A buy-in for that seed is just like a spin. It's literally like a spin. Right?"<p>He continued:</p>"So, things will look similar, right? Sometimes, things will look like the same buys, like, f**king 25 buys in a row. Right? And then, it'll ship something else. Because that's how the seeds are. It's how the seed is when you play the f**king game! It'll be a lot of very similar dog s**t in a little bit of time. And in another time, similar dog s**t."<p>Later in the discussion, the Quebec native <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>revealed his Stake gambling statistics</a>, showcasing that he had wagered more than $1.5 billion on 788,877 bets.</p><p><strong>Timestamp: 02:21:00</strong></p><h3>Fans react</h3><p>The YouTube comments section featured over 70 reactions to the livestream.
