Naturally, I’m usually pretty hesitant about trying new skincare products, so when I discovered a plastic-surgeon-owned brand, KaramMD, I was skeptical. Sure, <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Dr. Amir Karam</a> is a world-famous plastic surgeon with an undeniably <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>stunning </a>portfolio—but a plastic surgeon making skincare seemed like an astronomer doing astrology–very qualified in an adjacent field–but does it translate?</p><p>Regardless of my initial doubt, I acquiesced to my curiosity, especially because <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>KaramMD</a> promised to simplify my skincare routine, is suitable for sensitive skin, and is fairly affordable. The brand claims to gently target all signs of aging, including texture, fine lines, and firmness, with a cocktail of retinol, vitamin C, and other powerhouse ingredients. When I first received the KaramMD <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Trifecta</a> (the brand’s three core products), I pessimistically looked for the worst: irritants and ingredients that did not warrant the price tag. Instead, I found my favorite label, “vegan,” and I was instantly even more intrigued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop><p>I wouldn’t be writing this had I not woken up to impressive results (vegan or not): smoother, hydrated, vibrant skin, that keeps improving the longer I use the trio. I even had a scratch on my face that seemed to heal quicker once I started using the KaramMD products. Dr. Karam created the line to be effective yet gentle enough to use even after a procedure, whether it be injectables or going under the knife. The <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>products</a> can be used on the face, eyes, and neck, eliminating the need for half a dozen other creams and serums I currently use. Frankly, I did not anticipate how convenient that would be.</p><p>“Great skin is an incredibly important part of looking as young as you feel, and I have always advocated for a good skin routine and lifestyle for my patients.”</p><p>— Dr. Karam</p><p>The three core products can be purchased <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>as a set</a>, and as a special offer for The Daily Beast readers, use code DAILYBEAST15 for a 15% discount. For exfoliation junkies like me, there's also a <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>skin-polishing powder </a>that I'm also hooked on.</p><p>I spoke with Dr. Karam to find out why he launched the line—especially with such a successful practice, and he gave me the lowdown. “The KaramMD Trifecta was originally designed for my surgical patients. Great skin is an incredibly important part of looking as young as you feel, and I have always advocated for a good skin routine and lifestyle for my patients,” he said. “My patients had challenges with too many steps, confusion on what to use and cost, making it difficult to stick to the routine over time. This led me to [create] an easy-to-use, comprehensive yet simple, three-step routine. The results from the clinical studies were so significant that it led me to want to share it with the world.” Well, I’m, for one, glad he did.

It has a slight green-tea scent that I was worried would offend but doesn’t–if anything, I look forward to washing my face now with the easy-to-rinse-off, lightweight formula.</p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_4217,w_7497,x_0,y_1578/dpr_2.0/c_limit,h_251/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1677180411/4_PRODUCT_QUENCH_COMPOSITE_w4fnsg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=ConversionCard__title>KaramMD Quench Vitamin C Serum</p><p class=ConversionCard__special-info>Use Code DAILYBEAST15 for 15% Off</p><p>The next step is <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Quench</a>, a brightening serum that delivers three types of Vitamin C to boost collagen, with skin brighteners, and plumping Sodium Hyaluronate. The directions say, use 1-2 drops; I huffed, how is that supposed to cover my whole face? Well, it did; the highly viscous, not-sticky formula spreads enough to cover my neck, too. When I skip this step, it’s noticeable. This serum is notably safe for eyes, neck, and chest too.</p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_4055,w_7209,x_0,y_177/dpr_2.0/c_limit,h_251/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1677181302/Karam_09252114763_sjig7z style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=ConversionCard__title>KaramMD Illuminate (All-in-one) Anti-aging Cream</p><p class=ConversionCard__special-info>Get 15% off with Code DAILYBEAST15</p><p><a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Illuminate</a>, the moisturizer, is safe to use even near the eyes. The products are non-greasy and completely absorb quickly, also making a great base for makeup. What did I notice? Fresher, smoother, hydrated skin, no longer dull from winter skin syndrome (caused by cold air meets indoor heating). The priciest product of the line but the bottle is a full 1.7 ounces, so a good amount for a face cream. It contains Retinol but my skin has no reaction or peeling, as is sometimes the case.</p><p>Get even more reviews and recommendations straight to your inbox.
