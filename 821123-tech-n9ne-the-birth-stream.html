It's been seven years since he unveiled his last installment, and it's safe to say that fans are <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">ready for more</a>. Fortunately, they don't have to wait too much longer. COSM is expected to arrive on July 12 of this year and is available for pre-order now.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the meantime, the hitmaker has given listeners a taste of what's to come with a few singles like <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Drippy Drop,"</a> which he dropped earlier this month. He teamed up with Skatterman and Snug Brim for the fun, summer-ready song, and is back with more yet again. This time, he's unleashed a solo track called "The Birth," which leans into slightly more serious and introspective themes.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On the melancholy track, Tech N9ne reflects on some of his early days. He recalls realizing he wanted to be <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"an elite MC,"</a> watching his mother struggle with various health issues, ultimately being "set free" by music, and much more. It has a fittingly nostalgic sound, which lines up well with the lyrical content. What do you think of tech N9ne's nostalgic new track? What about its accompanying music video? Will you be adding "The Birth" to your playlist or not? Are you looking forward to hearing his new album COSM when it drops next month?
