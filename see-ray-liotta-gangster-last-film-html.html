Well, even though the legend <a href=#>has passed away</a>, we finally get to see him in one final gangster role, in arguably the strangest movie that is set to come out in 2023. Ray Liotta’s final gangster performance comes in Cocaine Bear, which is based on the true events of a bear that <a href=#>ate cocaine</a> that was dropped from a plane, which you can see in the trailer below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>It appears that the central figure of the above trailer, apart from the drug-rampaged bear, is Ray Liotta. With his shaggy hair, gold chain, and frilled shirt, he looks like the prototypical 1980s drug dealer. Quite honestly, we aren’t sure what we were expecting from the trailer, but seeing a bear go on a rampage so that it could do more drugs was something we certainly did not think was going to happen.</p><p>The bear in Cocaine Bear looks innocent enough, even throwing itself on the ground and acting cute, up until the drugs start to hit it. Then we see the massive growls and claws come out. Arguably one of the funniest moments from the above trailer is when the bear snorts some of the cocaine from a ripped-off arm, which we hope is not the arm of drug kingpin Ray Liotta.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cocaine-bear-900x506.jpg><p>Cocaine Bear does boast quite an impressive cast that includes Ray Liotta, Keri Russell, Margo Martindale, Alden Ehrenreich, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and so many more. The oddball horror thriller is also being produced and directed by <a href=#>Elizabeth Banks</a>, and from the looks of the movie, we can tell that she has brought in plenty of her comedic acting past. Even though the movie looks completely crazy, it proves that Liotta was a man dedicated to the art of acting.</p><p>Ray Liotta can clearly <a href=#>laugh at himself</a>, in the same way, that most of this cast can, as Cocaine Bear looks purely comedic. We are sure that the movie is not attempting to be a comedy, but it looks like an elevated <a href=#>B-level horror </a>thriller. Think of The Edge with Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin, but with a lot more drugs.</p><p>Cocaine Bear is based on an actual story from the 1980s, which saw a man by the name of Andrew Carter Thornton II (who might be the basis of Ray Liotta’s character) found dead on a driveway in Tennessee. He had around 77 lbs. of cocaine strapped to a bag on his waist. However, authorities found another bag that had around 75 lbs., which had been consumed by a black bear that naturally died from an overdose.</p><p>Cocaine Bear is set to hit theaters on February 24, 2023 and might become one of the unsung hero movies for the year. For those who love ridiculous premises, this might be the movie to go see, especially as it is <a href=#>one of the last appearances</a> by Ray Liotta. We certainly want to what it’s going to take for the people in this movie to take down the most violent apex predator the world has ever seen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irlZp6s63YZqOip6Sprm6zwKeerKyVp3qtrdKtZJ%2BhnKJ7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./753582-saucy-santana-rca-records-hip-hop-news.html><span>←</span><span>Saucy Santana RCA Records Rumors Go Without Answers As He Previews New Music: Watch</span></a>
