The newly opened space boasts a cool curation of vintage pieces, along with its own collection of sustainable, supersized scrunchies made from deadstock and recycled or discontinued fabrics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Offered in a range of colors from pink to tie-dye to this season's new lime green trend, the poufed organza designs are nothing like the scrunchies of the '80s and '90s. Ideal for those who bask in the art of being extra, the over-the-top scrunchies are (unsurprisingly) already flooding social media feeds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The scrunchie creations come from the husband-and-wife duo behind Room Shop Vintage, Shelly Horst and Dryw Scully. After quitting their jobs in retail, the couple began selling vintage finds from their road trips across the country. Their pieces were so in demand, they opened a store/showroom in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.buildingbok.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="South Philly's Bok building" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">South Philly's Bok building</a>. The dreamy space is now home to the scrunchies, along with the store's selection of vintage apparel, bags, and accessories.</p><img alt="Flower, Room, Plant, Floristry, Floral design, Textile, Table, Clothes hanger, Feather, Flower Arranging, " title="Flower, Room, Plant, Floristry, Floral design, Textile, Table, Clothes hanger, Feather, Flower Arranging, " width=2000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-shop-interior-sq-1563222648.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lauren Alexis Fisher</span><p>Inside Room Shop's dreamy showroom.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Room Shop's cloud scrunchies come in two sizes: the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://roomshopvintage.com/collections/giant-scrunchies/products/cloud-scrunchie-black-1 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="large, regular size" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">large, regular size</a>, which retails for $20; and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://roomshopvintage.com/collections/giant-scrunchies/products/mini-cloud-scrunchie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the mini cloud" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the mini cloud</a> (for those who want to be a little less extra), which retails for $12.
