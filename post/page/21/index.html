<a href=../../../is-aw-46-hydraulic-oil-the-same-as-iso-46-html.html></a>
Answer
ISO 46 merely refers to the vicosity of the situation. AW is an abbreviation for “Anti Wear.” Your AW Hydraulic Oil ISO 46 is going to be the same as your AW-46, thus no need to worry. Just the sequence of the phrases has been changed, not the meaning of the words.
What is the weight of ISO 46 hydraulic oil in light of this consideration? It is comparable to ISO 32 in terms of SAE 10W, ISO 46 and 68 in terms of SAE 20, and ISO 100 in terms of SAE 30 in terms of ISO 100.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Sai part of the Konoha 12?</h2><time>Aug 28, 2024</time>
