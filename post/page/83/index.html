As both Through Education and The Ed Advocate report, somehow a myth entered the world's collective consciousness that an Italian man named Roberto Nevilis invented homework. Some versions of the myth even add some context: It was intended to punish underperforming students and to reward those who excelled at their lessons. Some versions of the myth say that his invention dates to 1905, others that it dates to 1095 – an 800 year difference!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>TikTok star Anna Paul breaks silence over event mayhem: 'Last time cops saw this was for a Bieber co</h2><time>Aug 18, 2024</time>

Isabel May was a self-professed bookworm as a kid,&nbsp;but she didn't exactly have a knack for bringing words on the page to life on the stage.

Alex Bovaird, the costume designer for The White Lotus, is one of the best working on television today. I still think about that blue and white striped polo that Shane (Jake Lacy) wore in the opening scene of the first season.

<a href=../../../why-do-they-put-caffeine-in-painkillers.html></a>
Caffeine is added to some painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, to help them work better.
