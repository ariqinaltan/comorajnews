By James Brizuela | Updated 1 year ago Ray Liotta is one of the best actors the world has ever seen, especially when he portrays the role of a gangster.

Tetris tells an interesting origin story for the popular game, but doesn't trust events enough to not embellish them.
By Nathan Kamal | Updated 11 months ago TETRIS REVIEW SCORE
Apple TV+’s new film is something of an odd duck: an origin story for a video game so ubiquitous, most people would never even question how it became so. It cannot be denied that the path that Tetris took from a Soviet computer programmer’s pet project to ridiculously popular Nintendo Game Boy accessory is a strange and fascinating one, which raises the question of why it needed to be so heavily fictionalized for the movie.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Repair Shop's Jay Blades announces heartbreaking death details</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>

Maybe you haven’t washed your hair in a while, or maybe you’ve had it lazily tucked into a top knot for a few days. Then, out of nowhere, it starts to physically throb. Science says hair can’t actually hurt (hair is dead, after all), but that uncomfortable tender-headed feeling isn't your imagination. A sore, achy scalp can leave your hair feeling sensitive to the touch, causing you to avoid&nbsp;combing, brushing, or even washing your hair.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Worst Sports Haircuts Of All Time</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>

Of all the soccer stars who have sported some questionable 'dos, we're going to rat on Rodrigo Palacio. The soccer player has represented Argentina in two World Cups, with Reuters noting that he is "one of his most tactically astute players." He may be a highly gifted player on the pitch, but those skills don't seem to transfer to the bathroom mirror.
At first glance, Palacio is an elegantly poised athlete — but just wait until he turns around.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tributes pour in as country star Mickey Gilley dies aged 86</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../vintage-threads-repair-service.html></a>
With so many shoppers wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, resale is currently booming. But, not everything can be successfully sold on the secondhand market – some pieces are too worn to be passed down, and this leaves them at risk of being dumped into landfill. It is this exact problem that new business Vintage Threads is aiming to solve.
The concept is simple – the talented seamstresses rework tired designer and streetwear pieces into something completely different and actually desirable, meaning they won’t end up in landfill, and they will continue to be used.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/69/>← Prev Page</a>
