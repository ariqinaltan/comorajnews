You've Got My Back (Literally): Verifying a Michigan Controlled Substance License (and Avoiding Shady Meds)Let's face it, trusting a stranger with powerful medications is a bit like entrusting your grandma's secret cookie recipe to a raccoon.

But before you can hurtle yourself towards oblivion on a rollercoaster (metaphorically speaking, of course), there's one burning question: how much are those tickets gonna set you back?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How New Ontario Backlot Hosted Amazon's 'Reacher' Shoot</h2><time>Aug 14, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../new-ontario-backlot-amazon-reacher-1235128706.html></a>
Ontario has long been Hollywood’s go-to for Anytown, USA, for film and TV production. But fans of Amazon’s Reacher might be surprised to learn the crime thriller’s first season, which is set in a fictional rural Georgia town called Margrave, was mostly shot in an undeveloped corn field in Pickering, Ontario.
“Our original plan in the summer of 2020 was to shoot on location in a real Georgia town, but due to the pandemic, we pivoted to Toronto, where there were fewer COVID-19 cases and where we would be able to build a replica Georgia town — and fully control it,” says Drew Brown, executive vp production at Skydance Television.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How old is Oliver from Ni no Kuni?</h2><time>Aug 14, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../white-men-cant-jump-review-1235491456.html></a>
The poster for the original 1992 film White Men Can’t Jump featured a photo of its two stars, identified merely as “Wesley” and “Woody.” They were, of course, Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson, whose charismatic screen personas were already so well-defined that no further explanation was necessary. That’s not exactly the case with this ill-advised remake, which comes across as an uninspired retread that lacks its own reason for being other than its appeal to baby boomer nostalgia.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is GA a Scrabble word?</h2><time>Aug 14, 2024</time>
