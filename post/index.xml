With a heart that can't be broken,
Is like trying to see the light with eyes that can't be opened.
Yeah, we both carry baggage,
We picked up on our way, so if you love me do it gently,
And I will do the same.We may shine, we may shatter,
We may be picking up the pieces here on after,
We are fragile, we are human,</description></item><item><title> Whitney Houston O Holy Night lyri</title><link>/o-holy-night-html.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/o-holy-night-html.html</guid><description>O holy night!

For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees!
Oh, hear the angel voices!
