and slightly hilarious,</span><span> world of flamingos in the Mitten.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:33>Feathered Fashion Faux Pas?</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:84><span>Flamingos are built for balmy beaches,</span><span> not blizzardy backyards.</span><span> They thrive in warm,</span><span> shallow water where they can find their favorite food:</span><span> tiny brine shrimp.</span><span> Michigan's chilly lakes and frozen landscapes just aren't their vibe.</span><span> Imagine a flamingo in a snowsuit - adorable,</span><span> sure,</span><span> but probably not comfy.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:118><strong>So, the verdict?</strong><span> Flamingos as permanent residents?</span><span> Not likely.</span><span> Tourists on a tropical vacation gone wrong?</span><span>

(mostly brine shrimp).</span><span> So,</span><span> if you ever see a white flamingo,</span><span> they're probably just having a dietary deficiency.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=20:1-20:173><span>Those graceful legs aren't just for show!</span><span> Flamingos use them to stir up the water,</span><span> making it easier to catch their food.</span><span> Basically,</span><span> they're fancy flamingo food processors.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=21:1-22:0><span>A group of flamingos is called a "flamboyance.</span><span>" That's right,</span><span> a
