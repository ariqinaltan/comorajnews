He's in a way better place now to where we were a year ago,</strong> but diet has played a huge part in that. We always eat relatively well but he's quite into nutrition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/651ce698c351-alex-jones-charlie-concert.jpg><p id=eDzQcdJWOBQ data-wc=52>"I think it was a way for him as well to fill his days in a sense when he wasn't feeling well. And he decided to take on this kind of role of, right well we've got the medication but I'm going to see what else I can do to help myself."</p><p id=ePF3mdsr1R data-wc=62>The mum-of-three continued: "He used to be a chef so cooking and food is very much something he loves and it brings him a lot of joy. I'm very lucky he cooks most meals, but I do say it's the glory job because nobody says, 'You stacked that dishwasher so well,' so he does all the cooking, but we eat really well."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e302a6ed6c9a-alex-jones-charlie-thomson.jpg><p id=ew01xV8pyn data-wc=50>Sharing an insight into the family's new diet, Alex explained: "Lots of pulses, lots of greens, lots of vegetables, and this thing that was news to me that five to 10 a day isn't enough, it's the variety, eat the rainbow, I say it on a loop to my children."&nbsp;</p><p id=eggxmcvdw- data-wc=49>Speaking of Charlie's struggles earlier this year, Alex said: "It's my husband's own story to tell, so I won't go into detail, but he suffers with his mental health and we've just been through a really bad period where he had Lyme Disease and then he had viral meningitis.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b7560c5326a5-alex-jones-husband-kissing-photo-z.jpg><p id=eidQuVaZ-1 data-wc=59>"Lots of things happened recently. <strong>Charlie's super fun, but he became a shadow of himself. He was so ill; he really went downhill fast mentally.</strong> And again, I found myself at a loss thinking, 'Oh my God, I don't know what to do here.' We all talk a good game, but do we actually know how to help people?"&nbsp;</p><p id=ej34bsWxd1b data-wc=44>She added: "I thought I was losing him, as in not actually losing him. But I thought, 'Oh my God, where is he? I can't see him.' I was looking at him and I'm thinking, 'I'm looking and hearing somebody who's not my husband.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45tcHBqZWp8tbTEZqannV2otbDDjJqjnrBdn7yvsdJmn56ZnKm1bsHPnZitnV2dwrSuwKebZpuYlr%2BttcRmq6Gnnai8r3nDnpypZZSavbOx0qygqKZf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aldi-new-chocolate-vanilla-cake-pops.html><span>←</span><span>Aldi Just Dropped New Chocolate &amp;amp; Vanilla Cake Pops</span></a>
