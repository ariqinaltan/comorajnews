Fox is in the running to star as Madonna's longtime friend, actor Debi Mazar, <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> reports. The outlet reported that Fox is being seriously considered to portray Mazar, who is well-known for her roles in "Goodfellas," "Entourage," and "Younger." Fox's resemblance to Mazar is certain. In fact, the two actors already bonded over their similar looks in an August 2021 joint interview with <a href=#>Document</a>. "There was a series or movie where they were talking about me playing your sister!" Mazar said to Fox. "I don't know where that went. I was like, 'Julia Fox? I'm in.'"</p><p>Fox's potential role as Mazar confirms that she is indeed rising to stardom beyond her breakout role in "Uncut Gems." In September 2021, Fox revealed she has many future plans for her career. "I'm working on a book proposal right now," she told <a href=#>Interview</a>. "It's like a memoir and it goes really deep." The star also revealed she loves TV and hopes that someone will "give me a f**king job on a television show." With <a href=#>Kanye West now by her side</a>, there's no telling what Fox's next career move will be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGtnZ4Z2e8muo6KZXZu8ub%2BMqaasq5mXuaZ50aijnmWZo3qurcOopaeZo2KvqrvPoppmoaOjwW7Dx5qrZq%2BVYryztcaipZqknK56tbTOrp6hrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeremy-scott-karlie-kloss-hair-ghd.html><span>←</span><span>Jeremy Scott's anniversary fashion show: How to get Karlie Kloss' hair look</span></a>
