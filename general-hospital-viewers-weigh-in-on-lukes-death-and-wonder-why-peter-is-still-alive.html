There is a lot of hate for “Parking Lot Peter,” which became the big gripe.&nbsp;</p><p>One GH viewer tweeted, “We can randomly kill off-screen Luke but not Peter? Why? #GH”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Another said, “So let me get this straight #GH gets rid of an iconic character like Luke Spencer yet they refuse to kill off Parking Lot Peter??”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>It looks like the spectrum is all over the place where Luke is concerned, as noted by this viewer, who tweeted, “I like reading through all these tweets on Luke. Some happy he’s finally dead, those devastated the show would kill him off, some indifferent. But what seems to be the one constant is how annoyed everyone is that Peter still breathes#GH”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What happened to Luke on General Hospital?&nbsp;</h2><p>It’s been years since Anthony Geary was on General Hospital, and he left the ABC soap in 2015 when he retired from acting.&nbsp;</p><p>Luke was brought back in 2017 briefly, as he helped play a role in Jane Elliot’s exit as Tracy Quartermaine.&nbsp;</p><p>He doesn’t have ties to Port Charles anymore either. Lucky has been off-screen for years, Ethan (Nathan Parsons) has only been back briefly since his exit in 2012, and <a href=#>Lulu (Emme Rylan) was written off</a> when she was put into a coma after the Floating Rib explosion.&nbsp;</p><p>There is some concern about Victor Cassadine (Charles Shaughnessy) and his role in Luke’s death. He was speaking on the phone and mentioned “neutralizing” Luke Spencer, but the identity of who he was talking to was concealed.&nbsp;</p><p>Could Luke’s “death” be a farce? Is Victor holding him hostage somewhere while everyone believes he died in a tragic accident?&nbsp;</p><p>Be sure to tune in daily to see where this storyline goes.&nbsp;</p><p>General Hospital airs weekdays on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWirn5a9tHvGnqWeqpGheqm70qmgrZmcYsOqsdaeqaxlp5q2qLSMoqVmp55iuba3xKxknZ2RqbVurc2dZLCnnpmys3nWobBmqJWpsrN5yKxkrKyZoblurcuirZ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elizabeth-hurley-versace-dress.html><span>←</span><span>Elizabeth Hurley Recreates Famous Versace Pin Dress and Reveals What It Means to Her</span></a>
