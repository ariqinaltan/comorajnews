This is intended to make shipping parcels easier for customers and provide them with more options. A large percentage of customers work full-time hours during the week, making it difficult to get to a post office branch.</p><p>One of the most popular services under the Approved Postal Provider Program is Approved Shipper. This allows&nbsp;<strong>certain retailers to offer USPS shipping services</strong>. Customers can leave their parcels at the branches of participating banks, grocery stores, and other companies.&nbsp;</p><p>Read more: <a class=row-title href=# aria-label="“Do Amazon Packages Come Early? – (Explained)” (Edit)">Do Amazon Packages Come Early?</a></p><h3><span id=It8217s_all_about_customer_convenience8230>It’s all about customer convenience…</span></h3><p>This special partnership is beneficial for all the companies involved. For USPS, the main benefit is extra convenience for their customers. The other participating companies benefit from extra foot traffic and a small fee for the service. Many people will also take the opportunity to do some shopping, which increases revenue for those companies.</p><h3><span id=The_8216Stamps_To_Go8217_Service>The ‘Stamps To Go’ Service</span></h3><p>Stamps To Go is another popular service that is part of the Approved Postal Provider Program. This provides customers with a wide range of packing and shipping materials. Customers can purchase items from a store and pack and ship them in a single, convenient location.</p><h2><span id=Where_Can_I_Drop_Off_USPS_Packages_8211_Drop_Off_Locations>Where Can I Drop Off USPS Packages? – Drop Off Locations</span></h2><p>In the past, the main place to deposit your parcel was at a branch of the United States Postal Service. A large number of popular retailers now receive mail through the Approved Postal Provider Program. Here are twelve different places you can leave your parcel along with details of the available services.&nbsp;</p><h3><span id=1__United_States_Postal_Service_USPS_Collection_Boxes><code>1</code> United States Postal Service (USPS) Collection Boxes</span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/United-States-Postal-Service-USPS-Collection-Boxes.png alt="United States Postal Service (USPS) Collection Boxes" width=1200 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>These blue boxes can be found in locations that receive a lot of foot traffic. This is a convenient way of sending your parcel if it has been correctly packaged and you have attached the postage. All you need to do is place your parcel in the box, and it will be collected by a mail carrier. You can check the USPS website to find the location of your nearest collection box.</p><h3><span id=2__Self-Service_Kiosks><code>2</code> Self-Service Kiosks</span></h3><p><strong>USPS operates a large number of self-service kiosks</strong>&nbsp;that allow you to drop off your parcel. This is a good way of sending your parcel without having to visit a post office branch. Self-service kiosks can usually be found in major cities and other densely populated areas.</p><p>To find your nearest self-service kiosk, go to the USPS website. Select self-service kiosks from the dropdown menu. Once you arrive at the kiosk, you can follow the prompts on the screen to successfully ship your parcel.</p><h3><span id=3__Contract_Postal_Units><code>3</code> Contract Postal Units</span></h3><p>These contracted units serve as independent partners of the United States Postal Service through the Approved Postal Provider Program. Selected retailers are permitted to offer USPS shipping supplies and services. Customers can pay for their parcel to be shopped and have items packaged in one convenient location.&nbsp;</p><h3><span id=4__Walmartnbsp><code>4</code> Walmart&nbsp;</span></h3><p>This is one of the largest and&nbsp;<strong>most convenient companies that offer the USPS drop-off service</strong>. Most&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Walmart</a>&nbsp;locations in the United States offer this particular service. It is best to enquire about the service at the customer service counter in your nearest store.&nbsp;</p><h3><span id=5__Staples><code>5</code> Staples</span></h3><p>This office supplies company sells everything you need to properly pack your parcel and send it on its way. This is a good option if you have just purchased an item that you want to send right away.

Walgreens stores also sell packing tape and other materials to make sure your parcel is properly sealed.&nbsp;</p><h3><span id=7__CVS><code>7</code> CVS</span></h3><p>You can send a parcel and collect a prescription at the same time in a CVS store. Simply look for a drop-box bearing the United States Postal Service label and pop your parcel inside. If you need a little extra help, you can go to the customer service counter in the store.&nbsp;</p><h3><span id=8__Office_Depot><code>8</code> Office Depot</span></h3><p>Like Staples, visiting Office Depot is a good option if you also need some office supplies. You can find a whole host of office supplies and other types of items in one convenient location. Many locations offer&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">United States Postal Service</a>&nbsp;drop-boxes to make the process very quick and easy.&nbsp;</p><p>These drop boxes are usually located at the front of the store, so you don’t even have to go inside. If you are driving past on your way to work, simply stop and pop your parcel in the box. You can also take advantage of other postal services at the customer service desk in the Office Depot store.&nbsp;</p><h3><span id=9__Safeway><code>9</code> Safeway</span></h3><p>Also known as Albertsons in some parts of the United States, Safeway sells a huge range of groceries at low prices. These grocery stores are used by millions of customers, and Safeway also offers a range of convenient services.
