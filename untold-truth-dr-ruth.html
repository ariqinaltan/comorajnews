Plus, there's all that sex stuff. But above all, she's a person, and sometimes people upset you. Sometimes they buy the last frozen burrito at the grocery store. Sometimes they accidentally tell teenagers to make babies. And occasionally, they say unsettling things about rape.</p><p>In 2015,&nbsp; The Palm Beach Post reported on&nbsp;controversial comments Dr. Ruth made while appearing on The Diane Rehm Show. Specifically, she dismissed the notion of a woman being able to refuse sex once she's naked in bed with a man. As she put it, "Most of the time, they think she can say, 'I changed my mind.' No such thing is possible."</p><p>She didn't misspeak. In fact, she's held that same view for decades. <a href=#>According to The Harvard Crimson</a>, during a 1991 visit to Harvard, the Dr. Ruth asserted, "If you don't want to have sex, you have no business being naked in bed with someone." She further warned that "a woman can't tease." That's disconcerting to say the least. But <a href=#>as The Daily Beast observed</a>, her stance is rooted in her interpretation of Judaism: "In the Jewish tradition, it says that if that part of the male anatomy is aroused, the brain flies out of the head." Obviously, biology isn't Dr. Ruth's forte.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFkm1qbWelo8GwuMNmq6utpJ16pb6Mq6ytoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./texas-cop-aaron-dean-gets-nearly-12-years-for-killing-atatiana-jefferson.html><span>←</span><span>Texas Cop Aaron Dean Gets Nearly 12 Years for Killing Atatiana Jefferson</span></a>
