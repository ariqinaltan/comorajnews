The story of McDonald’s is often associated with Ray Kroc, the man who took a single restaurant and turned it into a global franchise powerhouse. However, the original founders of McDonald’s were Richard and Maurice McDonald, who opened the first McDonald’s restaurant in 1940. As we look at the net worth of the founder of McDonald’s in 2024, it’s important to clarify that we are referring to Ray Kroc’s estate, as the McDonald brothers sold their rights to the business in 1961.</p><h2 id=understanding-the-founders-net-worth-zXXBAbfVqy>Understanding the Founder’s Net Worth</h2><p>Before diving into the specifics of the founder’s net worth in 2024, it’s crucial to understand how the value of an estate can change over time.
