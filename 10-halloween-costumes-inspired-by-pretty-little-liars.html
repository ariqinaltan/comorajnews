No need to look any further than the glam and fashionable Pretty Little Liars. As if the show could make it any easier to find inspiration, the Halloween episode each year will give you even more convenient ideas. Here are our favorites:</p><h3>1. Red Coat</h3><h5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PLL-red-coat_rgiy3a.jpeg data-dimensions=360,640 alt="Pretty Little Liars Halloween costume ideas" width=640 height=360 data-width=640 data-height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Photo credit: ABC Family</h5><p>A red coat and a blond wig is all you need to get this inspired look. Maybe top it off with a pair of dark sunglasses. If the coat doesn’t have a hood, don’t fret. Just pop your collar to attain that mysterious guise.</p><p><a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1711958431-2-1.jpg alt="JJ Watt" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Why JJ Watt's Latest Family Photo Has Fans Saying It's 'Overkill'</span></a></p><h4><a id=yui_3_5_0_5_1402511820455_19 href=#>QUIZ: Are you a hard-core Pretty Little Liars fan?</a></h4><p>Go even bolder if you have an Alison mask. This costume is also great for groups. Add some mystery to your party by leaving notes from A, like, “I know your secret. Kisses, A.”</p><h3>2. Masquerade</h3><h5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PLL-masquerade_hvj0lj.jpeg data-dimensions=360,640 alt="Pretty Little Liars Halloween costume ideas" width=640 height=360 data-width=640 data-height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Photo credit: ABC Family</h5><p>Go for a glam mask and/or an intricate hat as a centerpiece for your night. This is a look the Liars love bringing to the show, whether or not it’s the Halloween special. Not only will you spark some great conversations about the piece, but it’s not cliché like wearing some cat ears.</p><p>You can even find a mask at a local craft store to create a unique and personalized look.</p><h3>3. Old-school</h3><h5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PLL-old-school_cond9f.jpeg data-dimensions=360,640 alt="Pretty Little Liars Halloween costume ideas" width=640 height=360 data-width=640 data-height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Photo credit: ABC Family</h5><p>The girls love taking it back a few decades in their Halloween special each year. For the Season 4 episode, the Liars all wore period pieces that were trendy and sexy. Although <a href=# id=auto-tag_ashley-benson_1 data-tag=ashley-benson>Ashley Benson</a> did mention her cleavage concerns <a href=#>during the girls’ Facebook live interview</a>, we doubt you’ll be running through a forest or jumping over any fences during your night. At least, we hope not.</p><p>Take your outfit up a notch with some lacy gloves or vintage brooches, which you should be able to find at any thrift shop.</p><h3>4. A</h3><h5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PLL-A_vndhai.jpeg data-dimensions=360,640 alt="Pretty Little Liars Halloween costume ideas" width=640 height=360 data-width=640 data-height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Photo credit: ABC Family</h5><p>All you need is a black hoodie and some dark eyeliner to get this creepy look. The bigger the hood, the better, seeing as the goal is to make your face look shadowed.</p><h4><a href=#>Who’s hotter: Keegan Allen vs. Ian Harding</a></h4><p><strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> Reference Ezra’s time in the hoodie by carrying around a <span>bottle of whiskey</span> mug painted with a black A and give people a gold star if they guess who you are.</p><h3>5. The Liars</h3><h5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PLL-black-dresses_pj2ptz.jpeg data-dimensions=360,640 alt="Pretty Little Liars Halloween costume ideas" width=640 height=360 data-width=640 data-height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Photo credit: ABC Family</h5><p>Got a few girlfriends and some little black dresses on your hands? That’s all you need to dress up as the four Liars. Decide who is going to be Aria (Lucy Hale), Emily (Shay Mitchell), Hanna (Benson) and Spencer (Troian Bellisario). Accessorize accordingly.</p><p>Remember: Aria is edgy and daring, Emily is sporty and relaxed, Hanna is a little glam and a little goth, and Spencer is preppy schoolgirl all the way.</p><p>Spice up the outfits by adding an additional friend or two into the mix, especially now that Ali’s back. You can even get some red duct tape and add a giant red A to a costume for a sixth friend.</p><h3>6. Drunk Caleb and Hanna</h3><h5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PLL-Caleb-and-hanna_u8n6m0.jpeg data-dimensions=360,640 alt="Pretty Little Liars Halloween costume ideas" width=640 height=360 data-width=640 data-height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Photo credit: ABC Family</h5><p>This is a hilarious costume idea for you older Liars. Bring a six-pack and mess up your hair. Hanna should probably have some vodka. Top it off with some grunge garb and you have the perfect couples outfit.</p><p>Make it even more realistic by adding some black streaks to the underside of your hair. You can do this with either hair paint or by getting some clip-in extensions.</p><h3>7. Pretty Little Liars meets Orange Is the New Black</h3><h5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PLL-orange-is-the-new-black_l0ejvf.jpeg data-dimensions=360,640 alt="Pretty Little Liars Halloween costume ideas" width=640 height=360 data-width=640 data-height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Photo credit: ABC Family</h5><p>Flashback to the Liars’ community service days and this is the perfect fusion costume idea. You can wear makeup and really flounce it up like the Liars would, but it’s still really simple because all you need is the orange jumpsuit. Don’t forget that perfectly messy ponytail and some eye-catching nail polish.</p><h4><a href=#>Pretty Little Liars finale kills off the biggest character yet</a></h4><h3>8. Get sexy as Barbarella</h3><h5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PLL-Emily-barbarella_ewrvwc.jpeg data-dimensions=360,640 alt="Pretty Little Liars Halloween costume ideas" width=640 height=360 data-width=640 data-height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Photo credit: ABC Family</h5><p>This was, by far, the hottest Halloween costume any of the Liars ever sported and you can get the same look. It’s a little more complicated then the other ideas on this list, but definitely attainable. Check out American Apparel for a metallic leotard. The cape can be attached using some fun fabric from the fabric store. If you have some knee-high tight boots lying around, all the better!</p><h3>9. Hot for teacher</h3><h5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PLL-hot-for-teacher_qqlwlz.jpeg data-dimensions=360,640 alt="Pretty Little Liars Halloween costume ideas" width=640 height=360 data-width=640 data-height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Photo credit: ABC Family</h5><p>Another couples outfit that will have heads turning: Aria and Ezra. Make sure Ezra goes for that nerdy hot look with a sweater over a collared shirt. Have him accessorize with a message bag filled with all sorts of Ezra-like goodies: a book of poetry, a bottle of whiskey and some red pens. And Aria needs to have that short, yet innocent, miniskirt. All the better if you have a stylish backpack.</p><h3>10. Radley Sanitarium nurse</h3><h5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PLL-radley-nurse_bfrlfa.jpeg data-dimensions=360,640 alt="Pretty Little Liars Halloween costume ideas" width=640 height=360 data-width=640 data-height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Photo credit: ABC Family</h5><p>Instead of going for the traditional nurses outfit, go Pretty Little Liars-style this year. Add some extra flair by going for bold lips and pinned-back hair. It’s an even better costume if you have a friend to dress up like Spencer à&nbsp;la her Radley days, always wearing pajamas and always sporting bags under her eyes.</p><h3>Which look are you planning on going for this Halloween?</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoaWBnfnaAlmhoaWWYlrmtu9aenKdlk6TAtcHMnqpmoZ6ovaq%2BxJ1km7Fdpb%2BmwNOyZKWhpKm5pnnLopirq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wwe-raw-january-15-2024-preview-confirmed-matches-start-time-and-how-to-watch.html><span>←</span><span>WWE RAW January 15, 2024 Preview: Confirmed Matches, Start Time and How to Watch</span></a>
