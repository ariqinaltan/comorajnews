However, for quite some time, Francia seems to have been upset with Selena. In a video taken by TMZ a few weeks ago, Francia was questioned about her relationship with Selena. She dodged questions multiple times, hinting at her dissatisfaction with Selena's behavior. Francia declined to answer whether they are still friends or if she would follow Selena back on social media. When asked if she would donate an organ again, Francia seemed more interested in helping others through the process.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For those who are unfamiliar with the situation, Selena and Francia have been good friends since they were children and worked together as young actors. In 2017, Francia <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">donated her kidney to Selena</a> after Selena's own kidney failed due to lupus. The two remained close after the successful surgery. Selena expressed gratitude to Francia for saving her life on numerous occasions. However, their relationship appeared to turn sour in November. Then, Selena stated in an interview that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Taylor Swift</a> <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">was the only person she was close to in Hollywood</a>. After Selena's statement went viral, Francia responded with "interesting" and unfollowed Selena on social media.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-why-selena-and-francia-are-no-longer-friends>Why Selena And Francia Are No Longer Friends</h2></span><p>Honoree Selena Gomez accepts the Woman of the Year Award with Francia Raisa onstage at Billboard Women In Music 2017 at The Ray Dolby Ballroom at Hollywood & Highland Center.

Francia Raisa's father, El Cucuy, is a well-known Spanish radio host. During an appearance on the Spanish news program Primer Impacto, he provided some context to the rift. According to El Cucuy, Francia ended her friendship with Selena because she continued to drink alcohol after the kidney donation.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When asked why Francia Raisa was not featured in Selena Gomez's highly anticipated documentary Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me, El Cucuy explained that it was because it was well-known what had occurred between them. He added that such conflicts were not uncommon in situations involving love, money, and fame. He went on to explain that the disagreement between Selena and Francia arose when Selena was drinking. Francia allegedly told Selena that she had not donated a kidney so that Selena could continue to drink and put stress on the organ. Ouch. What do you think about the situation? Do you think that's a good reason to stop being friends with someone?
