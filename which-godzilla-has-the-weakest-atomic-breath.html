On top of that, we can count Godzilla's dying breath supernova as a solar system buster.<h2>What is Godzilla's weakness?</h2>Godzilla's biggest weakness is his own atomic breath. This was demonstrated when Mothra used her scales to reflect Godzilla's atomic breath back at him, forcing him to retreat.<h2>What version of Godzilla is the strongest?</h2>Millennium Series Godzilla<p>This Godzilla had purple spikes and red atomic breath. He also retained the 1990s Godzilla's healing factor. But in Godzilla: Final Wars, Toho made it clear that this was strongest Godzilla had ever been.</p><h2>Can Godzilla be hurt by his own atomic breath?</h2>Godzilla can be harmed if his own atomic breath is reflected back at him. The Super X2 and the Heisei Mechagodzilla both demonstrated the ability to absorb Godzilla's atomic breath and fire it back at him with several times the force, visibly injuring him.<h2>GODZILLA'S ATOMIC BREATH From Weakest To Strongest (1954-2021-2022) Healthbars</h2><p></p><h2>How hot is legendary burning Godzilla?</h2>His answer: at least 5500 degrees F.

As it turns out, Godzilla has a second brain, which is located where his tails meets his torso. This brain is what controls Godzilla's movement.<h2>How much can Godzilla lift?</h2>Godzilla, in KotM, weighs 99,634 tons (199,268,000 pounds).

The opening credits for the MonsterVerse movie included various statistics and facts on each titan. An official Godzilla guidebook previously stated that his atomic breath has the temperature of 500,000 degrees Celsius — but what's the power behind that heat?<h2>Which Godzilla has the longest tail?</h2>The Hanna-Barbera Godzilla is a few meters taller, being exactly 400 feet tall. However, Shin Godzilla's fourth form was both the heaviest Godzilla, weighing 92,000 metric tons, and the longest, with a total body (head-to-tail) length of 333 meters.<h2>How hot is Zilla Jr atomic breath?</h2>Zilla Jr.'s atomic breath must have reached a temperature somewhere between 1.16575 trillion and 38.94585 trillion degrees Celsius!<h2>Which kaiju is the strongest?</h2>1 King Ghidorah<p>King Ghidorah is considered Godzilla's greatest rival and for good reason.
