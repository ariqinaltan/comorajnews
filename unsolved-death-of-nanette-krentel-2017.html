Krentel's husband Steve and her brother Bryan were both eyed with suspicion during the case.</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>People</a> magazine, Krentel's father Dan Watson has said that Krentel was thinking of leaving her husband not long before the murder, and Steve has even admitted to cheating on his wife of 22 years with a younger colleague. Although he was working at the fire station at the time of the <a href=#>fire</a>, he has since resigned from his post after it was discovered that he had had inappropriate relations with at least two different staff members. Steve has insisted that he and his wife had worked through their problems, despite family claims to the contrary, and has since passed a polygraph test and was no longer a suspect in 2018.</p><p>Concerns have also been raised about Steve's brother Bryan, an ex-con who was turned in to the police by the couple for destroying his mother's car. According to <a href=#>Nola</a> news network, in 2011 Krentel told her father that Bryan had threatened to burn the house down, and she also told her sister that he had threatened to rape her as well. While the police said in 2018 they are still interested in Bryan, surveillance footage has proven that he was at home on the day of the murder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9km9obXBgZMKvv86lrZ6cXZmyosDHZqafZZ6Wu6bA055kpKqVo8GmuIxrZ2pvXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./most-beautiful-national-parks-in-us.html><span>←</span><span>The 24 Most Beautiful National Parks In the United States</span></a>
