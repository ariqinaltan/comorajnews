The camera cut to her a handful of times throughout the game, where she could be seen jumping and cheering, and at one point, even chugging a drink.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Also, during <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/watch-post-malone-perform-america-the-beautiful-2024-super-bowl-1235820678/>Post Malone’s performance</a> of “America the Beautiful,” the singer and Lively were seen hugging and swaying to the music. Post Malone and Swift teamed up for the opening track, titled “Fortnight,” on her upcoming album&nbsp;The Tortured Poets Department.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Later, during a tense second half and overtime, Lively could be seen comforting a stressed Swift, as the scoreboard counted down. But when the Chiefs ultimately scored another Super Bowl win, the singer screamed and jumped with excitement, surrounded by her loved ones.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Grammy-winning singer later met Travis down on the field, after he gave an electrifying speech, and they shared a long <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-kiss-kansas-city-chiefs-win-super-bowl-1235822326/>hug and several kisses</a> to celebrate the team’s victory.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Swift’s Super Bowl attendance was highly anticipated as many fans questioned whether she would be able to make it to the big game since she had been in Japan until <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/taylor-swift-finishes-tokyo-show-super-bowl-1235821908/>Saturday for her Eras Tour</a>. Ahead of her first Tokyo show, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/taylor-swift-super-bowl-japan-travel-1235813757/>Japan’s embassy </a>in Washington, D.C. even tried to reassure concerned Swifties that the singer would be able to make it to the Super Bowl from a travel logistics standpoint.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Despite the 12-hour flight and 17-hour time difference, the Embassy can confidently Speak Now to say that if she departs Tokyo in the evening after her concert, she should comfortably arrive in Las Vegas before the Super Bowl begins,” the embassy said in a statement at the time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Swift went to her first Kansas City Chiefs game on Sept. 24, which proceeded to send social media into a frenzy. Following her first appearance, the singer has left quite an impact on the league, from criticism to jersey sales and more.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While some NFL fans have taken to social media to criticize the pop star and the football league for broadcasting shots of her at the games, others have <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/arnold-schwarzenegger-praises-taylor-swift-different-audience-nfl-1235821774/>commended her</a> for bringing a new audience to the NFL. Some fathers have even said her attendance has given them and their daughters something to bond over when watching the games.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The NFL’s heightened TV rating this season may also be attributed to Swift. As an example, when the singer attended the Chiefs-Jets game in October, alongside some of her famous friends including Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/nfl-taylor-swift-era-female-fans-1235614539/>NBC reported </a>a notable increase in female viewership compared with the season’s previous three&nbsp;Sunday Night Football&nbsp;telecasts.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Last year, after the Sept.&nbsp;24 game, the sportswear and fan merchandise company Fanatics also noted that it saw a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-impact-sports-nfl-ticket-sales-chiefs-game-viewership-1235604028/>400&nbsp;percent increase </a>in Kelce jersey sales, while Kelce reportedly earned half a million new followers on&nbsp;Instagram.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Now, after attending 12 total Chiefs’ games this season to show support for Kelce, including the AFC championship game in January, where she joined her boyfriend <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/taylor-swift-kisses-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs-afc-win-1235809143/>on the field afterward to celebrate</a> their win, the Super Bowl marks Swift’s 13th game — a lucky number for the singer as Swifties know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLWt2KWmq2WjrLanwIyaq62dnpnAbn6Pa2tmq6WlsrN5waiupWWkp663tdJmop6kk5p6cn6Sbm9raWlpfXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sofia-wylie.html><span>←</span><span>Sofia Wylie Wiki, Height, Age, Parents, Boyfriend, Family, Biodata, Net worth &amp;amp; More</span></a>
