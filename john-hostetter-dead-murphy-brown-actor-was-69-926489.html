Hostetter died Saturday in Port Orange, Fla.,&nbsp;after a long battle with cancer, his family announced.
Hostetter portrayed John the stage manager in 62 of the 247 episodes of the beloved 1988-98 CBS sitcom Murphy Brown, which starred Candice Bergen as a high-strung TV journalist.
When things went awry — and that was often — on the set of FYI, a primetime network program that was broadcast live, it was up to Hostetter’s character to keep things on track."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
