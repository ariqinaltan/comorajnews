What’s more, why does my FM transmitter have so much static? If you only hear static while listening to the radio and not when listening to CDs or other external audio sources, the issue is most likely with the antenna, tuner, or some other external source of interference. In certain circumstances, regardless of the audio source you use, you may hear static.
