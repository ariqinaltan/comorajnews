He declared his intentions for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">contesting for a seat</a> in the House of Representatives in Imo State. Ike sought to represent Ideato South LGA of Imo State under the Young Progressive Party (YPP). Unfortunately, his ambitions did not live to see the light of the day as he was defeated during the election, thus losing the seat.</p><h3>Emeka Ike's wife, divorce and kids</h3><p class=align-left>The actor's marriage life has not been as smooth and successful as his career. He has been married twice after his first union ended. Here are some highlights of his dating life.</p><h4><strong>First union and bitter divorce</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Initially, the actor was married to a half-Dutch half-Nigerian lady called Suzanne, who worked as a teacher. The couple tied the knot in 2000. Emeka Ike and his wife were blessed with four children. On 13th July 2015, Suzanne appealed for a divorce at the Lagos Island Customary Court.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5955e19af34891fe.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who's Matt Kaplan, Alex Cooper's boyfriend? Age, net worth, movies, dating history</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The divorce proceedings were finalized in 2017 after a two-year-long feud. According to the head of the court, the teacher had provided enough evidence to warrant the divorce. Previously, the actor wanted to reconcile with his wife, but he did not show any effort towards the same.</p><p class=align-left>The actor was given custody of the four kids, but their mother was given the right to visit them whenever she pleased. In addition, Ike was paid N300, which was the amount he had paid as the bride price as they were tying the knot.</p><h4><strong>Second marriage</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/314c145ecab56664.jpg><p class=align-left>The actor married after three years of being single. He exchanged his wedding vows with a lovely South African lady by the name, of Yolanda Pfeiffer. Emeka Ike and his wife first met at an award ceremony in Germany and fell in love almost immediately.</p><p class=align-left>They recently welcomed their firstborn daughter together. Emeka Ike and his family live in Lagos, Nigeria, where he is the Actors Guild of Nigeria.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/642df828dcd33782.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jamie Hector’s biography: age, height, scar, wife, net worth</span></p></a><h3>Death rumours</h3><p class=align-left>Is Emeka Ike dead? No, is he not. The actor is still alive and wowing his fans with his expertise in the film industry. He was just unlucky to find himself in one of the worst-known rumours, a celebrity death hoax.</p><h3>Where is Emeka Ike now?</h3><p class=align-left>The actor is back in the Nigerian filming industry with a bang. He had taken a break from the entertainment scene to cool off after the rough divorce battle. It was also alleged that he left the screen after a prolonged fight with the producers who asked for sex in<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> exchange for roles </a>in the film industry.</p>If you knock at their office and you can’t sleep with them, you won’t be allowed to act. Is it fair to tell a girl that ‘if I don’t sleep with you, you won’t get my favour?’ if God does that to us, where would we be today? The actor asked. Ask the smallest artiste about my position on the situation. I have stopped productions severally because of this sexual harassment. That’s why sometimes they get issues with me.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f6ac54c86953c8e3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Patrick Walshe McBride's biography: age, height, partner, is he married?</span></p></a><h3>Emeka Ike's net worth</h3><p class=align-left>The actor has managed to amass a significant amount of wealth from acting, production, directing and entrepreneurship. His <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth </a>is estimated to be $2 million.</p><p class=align-left>Emeka Ike is one of the most resilient and hard-working individuals in the Nigerian entertainment scene. This has given him both local and worldwide recognition.
