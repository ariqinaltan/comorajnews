Miss B Nasty had an issue with his a** too smh." Miss B Nasty later responded, claiming that despite having never met Cashington in person, he <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">told multiple women they were together</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-summer-walker-s-relationship-reveal-goes-south>Summer Walker's Relationship Reveal Goes South</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“He was telling me he loved me and when I declined said he would pull up to my city and make me love him," she explained. "He tells new models that we’ve dated and I’ve never met him... He’s locked models out of accounts. And runs accounts like he’s the model." Back in 2021, another woman took to the platform to accuse Cashington of verbally assaulting her after she collaborated with someone else, even though they didn't have an exclusive agreement. "He wants to keep every model to himself and tries to control all their social media and even tries to control their personal lives," Miss B Nasty responded at the time. "I wish more people would speak up about his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">harassment and 'stalker-ish' p*mp ways</a>.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Needless to say, the women's allegations against Cashington have Summer Walker's fans <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">concerned</a>.
