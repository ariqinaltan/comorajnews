It seems like moms these days can’t feed their baby without it becoming a huge ordeal. In a society full of sexualized content, is it really taboo for a woman to breastfeed her child? Moms everywhere should feel empowered to nurse their child&nbsp;— and if the mood strikes to take a selfie, like Blake did, that choice is up to you.</p><p><strong>More</strong>: Breastfeeding mom kicked out of pool for nursing her baby boy</p><p>As a mother of two little boys under 2 years old, I have way too many memories of dodging folks in public while breastfeeding so they could feel better. Whether I was ducking out into my car at the end of the parking lot or pacing up and down a public restroom, it can get very tiresome. Seeing other women breastfeed in public has inspired me to let down my guard and do the same. Thank goodness I did, as throwing a blanket over my shoulders saves me more time than trying to find a secret spot to nurse. In most cases, my infant son will finish his liquid gold within five or seven minutes. What’s the big deal?</p><p><strong>More</strong>: <a href=#>Why moms choose to breastfeed</a></p><p>Kudos to Blake and other mothers who aren’t ashamed to naturally feed their children. Hopefully breastfeeding will have less of a stigma so more moms can feel more comfortable. There should be no shame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jqmYq52eqbavs46aqa2hk6GytHuQaW9yb2ZqfKO4wKScZqSZq7KtxYybqZ6Zo6mzprHDoqWgZaOauae1xGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./halloween-gifts.html><span>←</span><span>9 Halloween gifts to get you into the spooky spirit</span></a>
