While “Notes on a Scandal” didn’t quite reach the heights of the <a href=#>season 10 reunion</a> —&nbsp;part one of which drew 4.6 million viewers over three days, an all-time Vanderpump high — 3.2 million viewers is still a big number for any cable show.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the key ad-sales demographic of adults 18-49, <a href=# id=auto-tag_vanderpump-rules_1 data-tag=vanderpump-rules>Vanderpump Rules</a> drew 1.8 million viewers, an 85 percent improvement on the season 10 premiere. It’s also the biggest 18-49 audience for any Bravo season premiere in more than six years —&nbsp;since The Real Housewives of Atlanta season 10 debut in November 2017.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Those figures don’t include streaming, NBCUniversal doesn’t regularly release detailed viewing data for Peacock. NBCU says viewing of the season 11 premiere more than tripled compared to season 10.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Production on Vanderpump Rules‘ current season began last summer, when the fallout from “Scandoval” —&nbsp;the revelation that series fixture Tom Sandoval had cheated on his long-time partner Ariana Madix with fellow castmember Rachel Leviss —&nbsp; was still fresh, although the show’s producers gave the cast a three-month break before filming resumed.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I don’t have any question that it was the right choice to hold just a beat,” showrunner Alex Baskin <a href=#>told The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “We were in a very different place just a few months later. Not that everything was resolved or everything had healed, but at least there was an openness to moving forward.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOr5innJWnvba5z2aprqSVqHq1woyrmK2hnpzAbr%2FEmqqopl1mfm680Z6kop2imnpyfpJub2pvZWd9cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wimbledon-day-7-celebrity-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Wimbledon Day 7: Sophie Winkleman and Salma Hayek command attention as they lead celebrity arrivals</span></a>
