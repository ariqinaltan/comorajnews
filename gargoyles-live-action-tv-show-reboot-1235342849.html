The project is described as being in early development at Disney Branded Television.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Gargoyles was made by Walt Disney Television Animation and aired three seasons, from 1994 to 1997. The premise involved gargoyle statues moved from a castle in Scotland to modern-day New York. Once in the Big Apple, the statues awaken from a thousand-year-old spell and take on the mantle of protecting the city, becoming, as the show’s narration gravely said, “stone by day, warriors by night.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The series, created by Greg Weisman, came during a time of innovation in series animation, with Gargoyles riding a wave of shows with more complex storylines and darker tones that also included Batman: The Animated Series and X-Men. As with those shows, Gargoyles burrowed into the consciousness of a generation of TV watchers who have given it cult status.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While Disney hasn’t overtly tried to adapt the series into other formats, it did try to develop a gargoyles-in-modern-times feature in 2010 around the same time it made The Sorcerer’s Apprentice. The latter disappointed at the box office, and the project stalled out not too long afterwards.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Dauberman wrote Annabelle, Annabelle: Creation and <a href=# id=auto-tag_annabelle-comes-home data-tag=annabelle-comes-home>Annabelle Comes Home</a>, which were produced by Atomic Monster and are an integral part of Wan’s The Conjuring Universe, the highest-grossing horror franchise of all time. He also penned Conjuring spinoff The Nun.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The partnership has been fruitful not only because of the box office success, but also professionally, as Dauberman moved from behind the typewriter to behind the camera, making his directorial debut with Annabelle Comes Home.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">And the two also worked together on Swamp Thing, the short-lived series based on the DC character that streamed on the now-defunct DC Universe platform.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Dauberman, repped by CAA, Industry Entertainment and Felker Toczek, has continued to be one of the top horror talents in town, penning the two-part adaptation of Stephen King’s It. The first part became the highest-grossing horror movie of all time. He also has King adaptation Salem’s Lot, which he wrote and directed for Warner Bros., in the can.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Atomic Monster was one of the companies behind the horror hit <a href=# id=auto-tag_m3gan data-tag=m3gan>M3GAN</a> and is developing a series adaptation of the Einer-winning comic The Good Asian, as well as well a feature adaptation of horror video game Dead by Daylight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOoJirn5%2Buuaa%2FjKWgr51dlrC1tc6nZK2uXai1sMOMq5ybp5%2BpenJ%2Bkm5qbWpoaYZw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristin-cavallari-mark-estes-children-cmt-awards.html><span>←</span><span>Kristin Cavallari's Boyfriend Mark Estes Would Have Kids</span></a>
