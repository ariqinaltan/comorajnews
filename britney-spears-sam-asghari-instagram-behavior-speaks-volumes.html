For one, they no longer wear their wedding rings. Second, they don't post their significant other or wipe them completely from their feed. Well, Britney Spears and <a href=#>Sam Asghari</a> did both.</p><p>TMZ reports the couple is heading toward a divorce, but some fans might have been ahead of the curve if they took a look at their social media. Asghari, who would post the "Gimme More" singer every now and then, hasn't <a href=#>shared a photo</a> of the two since Valentine's Day. This seemed like a major red flag that the couple was facing some bumps in the road, especially because the couple's first wedding anniversary passed with not a single post from Asghari.</p><p>If the model's Instagram wasn't a sign the couple's relationship was falling apart, then Spears' feed definitely was. Just over a week ago, the "Toxic" singer shared a photo of herself sporting her wedding ring. However, in the past couple of days, Spears has shared <a href=#>several posts</a> of herself without the meaningful piece of jewelry. In one of those <a href=#>Instagram posts</a>, the musician even revealed that she was angry, she wrote, "Ok so I was a little pissed this day!!!" Perhaps she was mad at her hubby, Asghari. Regardless, the posts both Spears and Asghari have shared recently indicate their relationship was on the rocks for a while.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtmbYB3go6bqaKsnprGbr%2FPnpirq12orq55wKyeoZminnqqutKtmKCqkaJ6o7HHmq2ip6JiwLGxwKSqZq6focKusdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./711449-boosie-badazz-pound-town.html><span>←</span><span>Boosie Badazz Puts His Spin On Sexyy Red's &amp;quot;Pound Town&amp;quot;</span></a>
