The controversial rapper, known for his raw and unfiltered persona, has been no stranger to the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. From arrests and attempted murder charges to his behavior online, he’s largely made headlines in recent months due to his controversy rather than his actual musical output. Below, we’ve explored some of the most shocking scandals that have surrounded the rapper, including his tumultuous relationships with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Chrisean Rock</a> and her family.</p><p><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=# rel>Blueface & Chrisean Rock’s Relationship: A Complete History</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-arrests-and-attempted-murder-charge>Arrests And Attempted Murder Charge</h2></span><p>Blueface perform at O2 Academy Brixton on November 20, 2019 in London, England.</p><p>Blueface's journey to fame has been marred by several run-ins with the law. Perhaps one of the most significant incidents was when he faced <a href=# rel>an attempted murder charge</a>. Las Vegas police arrested the rapper in relation to a shooting that occurred outside of Euphoric Gentlemen's Club. Police claimed that Blueface reacted after an individual cracked a bad joke and allegedly fired shots into the man’s vehicle. Blueface was released on $50,000 before footage of the alleged incident surfaced online, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">KLAS-TV</a>. The latest update is that he pleaded guilty in the case. This arrest led to an intensified scrutiny of the rapper's life, attracting media attention and raising questions about his character.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel>Blueface Reflects On His “House Arrest” In New Single: Stream</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-attempted-robbery-arrest>Attempted Robbery Arrest</h2></span><p>Adding to his growing list of legal troubles, Las Vegas police also arrested Blueface for <a href=# rel>a robbery in Las Vegas</a> in June 2023. Although details are scarce, there have been reports indicating that his then-girlfriend, Chrisean Rock, was present at the time of the altercation at the Palms Casino.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=# rel>Chrisean Rock & Blueface Go Clubbing Together After Robbery Arrest, Social Media Reacts</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-controversy-at-skid-row>Controversy At Skid Row</h2></span><p>In a bizarre and highly publicized event, Blueface courted controversy when he visited Skid Row in Los Angeles. The rapper's actions during this visit sparked outrage as he was seen throwing cash into the air in an attempt to showcase his philanthropic side, attracting a chaotic scramble for money among the vulnerable residents. Critics accused him of being insensitive and exploiting the plight of those less fortunate.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel>Blueface Accused Of Humiliating L.A.’s Homeless After Tossing Cash Around</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-public-feuds-with-blueface-s-mother>Public Feuds With Blueface's Mother</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 14: Blueface attends Daniels Leather Fashion Show at Blue Moon on September 14, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage)</p><p>Blueface's tumultuous relationship with his mother has made headlines multiple times. Public fights between the two have surfaced through social media posts and Zeus Network’s Cr*zy In Love, which documents the relationship between Chrisean Rock and Blueface. These moments reveal a strained bond fraught with tension and conflict. Ultimately, the turmoil in their relationship extended to his siblings and raised concerns about the rapper's behavior, as well as his ability to handle personal relationships in a healthy manner.</p><p><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=# rel>Chrisean Rock & Blueface Booted From Rolling Loud Over Weapons On “Crazy In Love” S2 Premiere</a></p><span></span><p>In the midst of Chrisean Rock’s ascent in social media fame, she caught the attention of a plethora of celebrities, including Rick Ross, Chris Brown, and Lil Baby. Although Blueface’s issues with Ross and Baby derived from their personal interactions with Chrisean, the West Coast rapper took aim at Chris Brown for seemingly poking fun at their volatile relationship. Ultimately, Blueface resorted to bringing up Chris Brown’s domestic violence case involving <a href=# class=text-word rel>Rihanna</a>.</p><p>As for Akademiks, the two began trading barbs on social media, largely related to financial standings and their overall careers. While Akademiks suggested that Blueface fell off, backing up his claims with reports of <a href=# rel>the rapper’s home being in pre-foreclosure</a>, the two eventually <a href=# rel>agreed to set up a boxing match</a>. So far, nothing’s materialized.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=# rel>Akademiks Responds To Blueface Yet Again</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blueface-s-troubled-connection-with-chrisean-rock>Blueface's Troubled Connection With Chrisean Rock</h2></span><p>BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 24: ChriseanRock and Blueface attend the 2nd annual Hollywood Unlocked Impact Awards at The Beverly Hilton on June 24, 2022 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Prince Williams/Getty Images)</p><p>At the center of several controversies, Blueface's relationship with Chrisean Rock has been both shocking and disturbing. Allegations of abuse emerged, painting a troubling picture of the dynamics between the two. The accusations against Blueface have had significant implications for his public image. This later led to debates about accountability and the treatment of women in the entertainment industry.</p><p>More specifically, Blueface’s general attitude towards Chrisean Rock’s pregnancy announcement created more tension between the couple. Although the rapper made it clear he didn’t want to pursue a family with Chrisean, she continued to declare her love for him. The drama played out publicly and created a main storyline in the second season of Crazy In Love.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=# rel>Chrisean Rock Refers To Blueface As Her “Dusty Ex”</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-relationship-with-his-son>Relationship With His Son</h2></span><p>Blueface’s relationship with his son has also come under scrutiny. Critics have questioned his parenting skills in the past. Most recently, Blueface faced backlash after exposing his 6-year-old to strippers and later asking him whether he’s gay. These videos raised concerns surrounding responsible parenting and appropriate behavior as a role model.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=# rel>Hot Boy Turk Defends Blueface Celebrating His Son’s Sexuality</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-beef-with-chrisean-rock-s-family>Beef With Chrisean Rock's Family</h2></span><p>Adding fuel to the fire, Blueface engaged in a heated dispute with Chrisean Rock's family members. In season one of Crazy In Love, the “Thotiana” rapper got into a heated confrontation with Chrisean Rock’s father. Her dad assaulted Blueface for putting hands on Chrisean before the rapper punched him back. The animosity expanded throughout Chrisean’s family, including her sisters, who criticized the viral personality’s relationship with Blueface.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel>Chrisean Rock Says Blueface Is The Father Of Her Child After Taking DNA Test</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-conclusion>Conclusion</h2></span><p>From arrests to controversial behavior, Blueface has faced his fair share of criticism over the past few years. Although it hasn’t necessarily worked in his favor in the court of public opinion, he clearly abides by the age-old saying, “There’s no such thing as bad publicity.” Although his music career is stagnant, he’s leveraged his scandals into a successful reality show, along with endeavors on OnlyFans and other social media platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmboN4fJFmmaWtlZuupLGMnJ%2BroaOarq950aiapGWRp7%2Bmv9OsZJynnqm%2FsMLEq6qinaNiwKStzZ2Ypas%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./218430-bhad-bhabie-receives-gucci-purse-from-xxxtentacions-mom-for-16th-birthday-news.html><span>←</span><span>Bhad Bhabie Receives Gucci Purse From XXXTentacion's Mom For 16th Birthday</span></a>
