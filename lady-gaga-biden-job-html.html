Gaga will join her other co-chair producer and Oscar winner Bruce Cohen along with committee members <a href=#>Kerry Washington</a>, Jon Batiste, George Clooney, <a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a>, Troy Kotsur, Shonda Rhimes, Marta Kauffman, and more (<a href=#>via Billboard</a>).</p><p>So, what exactly will Lady Gaga do as co-chair of Biden’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities? Well, the committee was established in 1982 with the purpose of advising the President on “cultural policy” while also working to improve and support arts, humanities, museum, and library services. As far as resumes go, Gaga’s certainly fits the position.</p><p>Lady Gaga is an Oscar winner, a multi-platinum Grammy-award-winning music artist, an activist, and a philanthropist. It’s not hard to imagine why President Biden chose to put her on a committee that covers all of these areas. It’ll be interesting to see what Gaga does in the position and how she helps to improve all of these areas of arts and humanities.</p><p>While Lady Gaga isn’t busy being appointed by President Biden for important committees, she’s likely working on her next <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=upcoming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>upcoming</a> film. Gaga was cast as Harley Quinn in the upcoming sequel to Todd Philips’ <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Joker data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Joker</a> titled Joker: Folie a Deux. <a href=#>Joaquin Phoenix</a> will be reprising his role as Joker, Zazie Beetz will be reprising her role as Sophie Dumond, and new cast members include Brendan Gleeson, Harry Lawtey, and Catherine Keener.</p><p>Lady Gaga will get to show off a few of the talents that helped earn her a position on Biden’s committee when she appears in Joker: Folie a Deux. Apparently, the film will be a musical, so we should get some singing, acting, and maybe even dancing from Gaga. In fact, it wouldn’t be surprising if she ends up helping write some of the songs for the film as well.</p><p>It would be interesting for Lady Gaga to join the greater DCU as Harley Quinn, but <a href=#>James Gunn</a> has confirmed that Joker: Folie a Deux is firmly in the DC Elseworlds projects at DC Films. Essentially, this means these films are in a separate continuity from the main DCU films, which allows actors to play different characters from the mainline films and creatives to tell different stories without having to worry about what’s going on in the DCU. Then again, Gaga might be too busy working on her Biden committee to really commit to a demanding, multi-film role in a major comic book universe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lady-gaga.jpg><p>Right now, Joker Folie a Deux is the only upcoming film project on Lady Gaga’s docket, which makes sense since she has her philanthropy, her cruelty-free cosmetic brand, and her new position on President Biden’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. She might be a little busy for the foreseeable future, and she tends to be fairly selective with her film projects anyway. While we wait to find out what Gaga has planned next, we can look forward to seeing <a href=#>Joker: Folie a Deux</a> on October 4, 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnnJaxunnGmp6aZZKesaa6jKOmm2aYqbqt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./440526-kevin-hart-reveals-his-father-passed-away-give-mom-a-hug-for-me.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Hart Reveals His Father Passed Away: Give Mom A Hug For Me</span></a>
