reading this guide.<br><h2 data-sourcepos=1:1-1:64>Military Mission: Conquering the San Diego Zoo on a Budget</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:52><span>So,</span><span> you're a brave soldier (or sailor,</span><span> or airman,</span><span> or...</span><span> you get the idea) stationed in San Diego,</span><span> and you're itching for an adventure that doesn't involve camouflage and KP duty.</span><span> The San Diego Zoo is calling your name,</span><span> with its furry,</span><span> feathery,</span><span> and sometimes-scaly residents.</span><span> But before you suit up for your next expedition (khaki cargo pants don't count!</span><span>),</span><span> let's crack the code on those zoo tickets.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:54>Operation Free Entry: Active Duty Gets a Salute</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:390><span>First things first,</span><span> </span><strong>active-duty military personnel get a whopping 100% discount</strong><span> (that's military speak for FREE!</span><span>).</span><span> Just show your valid ID at the gate,</span><span> and those lions,</span><span> tigers,</span><span> and bears (oh my!</span><span>) will be lining up to welcome you.</span><span> Consider it a small token of appreciation for your service (and maybe a way to keep you away from the penguins...</span><span> those little guys can be troublemakers).</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=9:1-9:39>Dependents Deploy for a Discount</h3><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:391><span>Military spouses and dependents,</span><span> fear not!</span><span> You may not get a full pardon from park fees,</span><span> but you do snag a </span><strong>10% discount on a 1-Day Pass</strong><span>.</span><span> Just flash that dependent ID card and get ready to explore.</span><span> Think of it as your reward for putting up with all those early mornings and deployments (and maybe for convincing your significant other that khaki cargo pants </span>are<span> a fashion statement).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:144><strong>Important Note:</strong><span> This discount applies to both the San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park,</span><span> so you can choose your animal adventure.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=15:1-15:52>Intel on Regular Ticket Prices (Just in Case)</h3><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:152><span>Now,</span><span> for our civilian friends tagging along (or those sneaky soldiers trying to sneak in a plus one),</span><span> here's a quick rundown on regular ticket prices:</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=19:1-21:0><li data-sourcepos=19:1-19:38><strong>Adult

data-sourcepos=22:1-22:99><span>There are also some multi-day and package deals available,</span><span> but those are classified information for another briefing.</span></p><h2 data-sourcepos=24:1-24:55>Frequently Asked Questions: Your Mission Debriefing</h2><p data-sourcepos=26:1-26:137><strong>How to snag that military discount?</strong><span> Easy!</span><span> Just show your valid military ID (active duty) or dependent ID card at the ticket window.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=28:1-28:276><strong>How much does it cost for my family to visit?</strong><span> That depends on your family size and if anyone qualifies for the military discount.</span><span> Check out the zoo's website for current pricing on regular tickets </span><a class=traceable-link rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>https://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/tickets</a></p><p data-sourcepos=30:1-30:110><strong>Is there a discount for veterans?</strong><span> Unfortunately,</span><span> there is

at the gate.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=34:1-34:153><strong>What should I wear to the zoo?</strong><span> Comfort is key!</span><span> Think breathable clothing and shoes you can walk in all day.</span><span> Leave the camouflage at home,</span><span> though – you might blend in with the zebras!</span></p><p data-sourcepos=36:1-36:289><span>So there you have it,</span><span> soldier!</span><span> With this intel,</span><span> you're all set to conquer the San Diego Zoo and have an unforgettable adventure.</span><span> Just remember,</span><span> don't try to pet the lions
