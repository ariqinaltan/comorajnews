An actor like her mother, she was most known for her roles in the movies "Shag" and "Tokyo Pop" and the television series "Fame," though she also made appearances on "The X-Files" and "Beverly Hills, 90210," among other shows, per her <a href=#>IMDb</a> page. She also played the role of Maureen Johnson in the first national tour of the musical "Rent." She married musician Mark Templin in 1994, but the couple divorced four years later in 1998 and did not have any children together, per <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Unfortunately, like others in her family, Hamilton struggled with addiction. He issues began around the age of 13, per <a href=#>ABC News</a>, and&nbsp;she spent time in multiple rehabilitation facilities before becoming sober at age 17. Reflecting on her daughter's addiction, Burnett told <a href=#>ET</a>, "Finally we got tough and sent her to rehab ... and she hated me for it; she was 17, but I knew that was the last time she could do it because she would be turning 18. ... I realized then that I had to love her enough to let her hate me."&nbsp;</p><p>Hamilton was a people person, according to her mother. "One time she was in New York and it was the winter, and homeless people would come up and ask for money. She would say, 'I'll give you $10 if you tell me your story.' She would collect those stories and write about them," Burnett told <a href=#>People</a> in 2018.</p><p>If you or anyone you know is struggling with addiction issues, help is available. Visit the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website</a> or contact SAMHSA's National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG1kbYV3e9ahpmaZopp6pK3RqKNmmqWnu6bA06xknKCZobGzsc1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-travel-size-spray-deodorant-is-allowed-on-a-plane.html><span>←</span><span>What travel size spray deodorant is allowed on a plane?</span></a>
