That's not the point of life. You've got to thrive, you've got to feel happy. I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I tried, I really tried. But I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After Bradby noted that the wealth and status associated with her and the royal family inevitably goes hand in hand with media attention, Meghan responded, "I think the grass is always greener. You have no idea. It is really hard to understand what it's like. The good thing is that I have got my baby and I have got my husband and they are the best."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the same interview, Meghan said that her British friends had warned her against marrying Prince Harry. "When I first met Harry, my friends were so excited. My U.S. friends were happy because I was happy," the duchess said. "But my British friends, they were sure he was lovely, but they said I shouldn't do it because, 'The British tabloids will destroy your life.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Harry & Meghan: An African Journey will air in the United States on Wednesday, October 23, at 10 p.m. ET, on ABC.</strong></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
