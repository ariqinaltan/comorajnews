While blatantly ignoring <a href=# class=text-word rel>Chrisean Rock</a>, who's currently carrying his third child (<a href=# rel>allegedly a boy</a>), the Californian loudly and proudly praised Jaidyn Alexis on Twitter, who gave birth to his first two kids. "I don’t play about my BM she a solid bitch, but a boof one will get played with all day," Blue wrote at the time, seemingly referring to his Crazy In Love co-star in the latter half of his tweet.</p><p>While Rock didn't offer much of a reaction to her baby daddy's social media antics, we have heard her express <a href=# rel>regret in moving forward</a> with her pregnancy in recent weeks. Despite all the drama, however, it appears she and Blueface are on speaking terms again, as they recently linked up for her to take a lie detector test. The 26-year-old documented the process on his Instagram Story, showing the pregnant, embattled entertainer hooked up to the machine while he interrogates her.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Blueface Celebrates Jaidyn Alexis On Mother's Day: "I Don't Play About My Baby Mama"</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blueface-puts-his-baby-mama-to-the-test>Blueface Puts His Baby Mama to the Test</h2></span><p>"Answer the question. I'm asking the questions here. Is this the biggest d*ck you ever seen?" Blueface asks Chrisean. After the Maryland native responds "Yes," the man conducting the test confirms that she's telling the truth. "Is this the best sex you ever had?" is the "Thotiana" hitmaker's next inquiry. "Yes," his second baby mama replies without hesitation, also earning a positive response from the technician.</p><p>It remains unclear exactly why Blue had his partner in crime sit down for a lie detector test, though many online have asked why he didn't press for info about the paternity of Rock's child. In the past, the OnlyFans creator has suggested that the unborn baby <a href=# rel>may not be his</a>, asserting that the 23-year-old had slept with several other men in the past year. Regardless of the past, the pair continues to come <a href=# rel>back together</a> while awaiting the little one's arrival. For more pop culture and hip-hop news updates, check back in later this weekend.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Chrisean Rock Tries To Set Blueface's House On Fire, He Shares The Aftermath On Social Media</a></strong></p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbIV6fpZmmqGqmaiyorqMq6aco12XubaxxZqanmWcnrJusMStnJysn6d6tbHSrWSvoZSavA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-kilz-paint-be-tinted-html.html><span>←</span><span>Can Kilz paint be tinted?</span></a>
