The quality is indisputable and every purchase is one intended to live a long, happy life in your wardrobe.</p><p>While I could wax poetic about iconic Chanel accessories, I'm here to focus on the classic slingback two-tone pumps. These have been a cornerstone of the shoe offerings from the house since the 1950s and had a recent resurgence in Chanel's&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2015-ready-to-wear/chanel referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Fall 2015 collection</a>. As the only shoe shown with every look, Lagerfeld cemented the idea that you can wear it with just about everything.</p><p>For this story, I tried out a navy and black tweed pair, similar to the below.</p><a href=# data-model-name="Slingbacks Embroidered Fabric & Grosgrain White & Black" data-url=https://www.chanel.com/us/fashion/p/G31318Y55220K2781/slingbacks-embroidered-fabric-grosgrain/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chanel.com%2Fus%2Ffashion%2Fp%2FG31318Y55220K2781%2Fslingbacks-embroidered-fabric-grosgrain%2F&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=chanel.com data-merchant-id=204044 data-merchant-url=chanel.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vJjufPNyjiw72mtK98AJrS-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Chanel Slingbacks Embroidered Fabric & Grosgrain White & Black</p><p>Before we go any further, I'm going to give it to you straight: at $875, these shoes are definitely an investment. Yet, I will stand by the fact that the combinations of what you can pair them with are practically limitless.</p><p>In this five-outfit lineup I'm putting forth your way, they already break down to $175 per wear. I'm no mathematician (hence, why I ended up as a fashion editor), but it's safe to say some of you may have shoes only worn once for $175 sitting in your closet. Just sayin'. Of course, maintenance is a super important factor if you want to take the plunge here. Definitely consult your local cobbler, but proper upkeep that I would recommend is rubberizing the soles if you walk a lot and weekly polishing the leather toe and heel to buff out scuffing. I don't mean to be a nag, but taking care of your shoes will drastically extend their lifetime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vJjufPNyjiw72mtK98AJrS-1920-80.jpg><p>Aside from being a very classic style, this version in the navy tweed fabrication is extremely versatile. For anyone who has the irrational phobia of pairing navy and black, it's time to get over it. It's an insanely chic combination.</p><p>The comfortable mid-heel height is ideal for daily wear. Even working from home, I felt put together and focused but also not insane for wearing these around the house. Getting dressed these days is still a challenge, especially with pumps, but I kept comfort top of mind and with a few little twists and tricks, put together easy looks for these shoes that anyone can master.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

I was&nbsp;stunned&nbsp;how much I liked the pumps with these. I would normally throw on a ballet flat or sneaker, but the pumps are just as easy to wear but much more unexpected.
