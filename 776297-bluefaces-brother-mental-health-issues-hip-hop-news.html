In recent days, however, Chrisean's fans have been out in full force to defend her. Earlier this week, Karlissa Saffold took to Instagram Live to open up about her other son Dre's current battle with his mental health. The stress of the situation left the worried mother in tears.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I have done everything I can for him," she explained. "Since before he went to jail... I was not privy to mental health. I mean, it might look like we're doing some mental circus sh*t, but me and Blue are really just trying to create generation wealth for this family." While most viewers can empathize with Saffold's situation, others took the opportunity to drag her, reminding her of all the times she <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">dissed</a> Chrisean Jr. and his mom.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-karlissa-saffold-says-she-s-done-everything-she-can-for-dre>Karlissa Saffold Says She's "Done Everything" She Can For Dre</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"So talking bout chrisean baby every other day then come on here crying WHO GONE TAKE YOU SERIOUS," one user writes. Another says, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Karma for dragging Chrisean Jr."</a> In the past, Saffold has accused Chrisean Jr. of having a neurological disorder, such as fetal alcohol syndrome. For obvious reasons, this sparked outrage among Chrisean Rock's fanbase. The Baddies star denies rumors that her son has a disability.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At the time of writing, it's unclear exactly what kind of mental health issues Dre is dealing with. Last week, however, Wack 100 went live to tell fans that Blueface is doing alright following <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his fight behind bars</a>. During his livestream, he claimed that Dre had spearheaded rumors that Blueface had been stabbed. Wack 100 says this is false, and the altercation was nothing but a minor "scuffle."
