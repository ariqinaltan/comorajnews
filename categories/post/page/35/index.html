Pamela Anderson made us stop in our tracks when she walked into the fall 2017 Dolce & Gabbana fashion show in Milan this past February. The 49 year old former Playmate looked refreshingly demure in a black floral dress with matching ornate sunglasses and lady-like pointed-toe heels. The look, to put it plainly, won fashion. And it wasn't a one-off moment, either. Since then, Anderson, best known for peeling off the layers is instead revealing a very different side of herself when it comes to fashion.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rick Ross &amp;amp; His Crew Brutalized By Drake's Alleged Goons In Viral Fight Footage</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

Supposed images of a new Silent Hill game leaked Thursday, and were quickly taken offline due to a copyright claim from publisher Konami, according to a series of tweets from reputable horror game leaker Dusk Golem on Twitter. While those images have been removed from Twitter, they have proliferated across the internet, offering an unconfirmed look at a new Silent Hill project — supposedly one of multiple games in development. So far, five images of the untitled Silent Hill project have been leaked, including what appears to be a screenshot of a dirty, trash-filled apartment; a close-up visual of a woman’s face stylized to look like torn paper; a screenshot with text that appears to be an email containing information about a child neglect investigation; and a screenshot and artwork of a hallway covered with sticky notes, with a humanoid character covered in what appears to be flower blossoms.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Snoop Dogg Reveals He Wasn't A Fan Of &amp;quot;Hit 'Em Up&amp;quot;</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>
