Answer
Solution: Place several inches of mulch around the base of the tree to protect it from the elements (not touching the trunk). The mulch will keep the soil cool while also assisting it in retaining moisture. During hot, dry weather, check the leaves on a frequent basis. If you see drooping leaves on your tree in the morning, water it promptly and thoroughly.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Many Dogs Are You Allowed To Have In San Diego</h2><time>Aug 28, 2024</time>
