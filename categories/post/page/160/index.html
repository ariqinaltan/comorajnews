[This story contains spoilers from the series finale of ABC’s&nbsp;Scandal,&nbsp;“Over a Cliff.”]
The Gladiators have left their arena.
On Thursday, ABC and&nbsp;Shonda&nbsp;Rhimes&nbsp;closed up Olivia Pope and Associates for good as&nbsp;Scandal&nbsp;wrapped its seven-season run with a series finale that explored the ramifications of going public with the existence of black-ops group&nbsp;B613 and the ultimate corruption that comes with the thirst for power and the Oval Office.

<a href=../../../../is-dublin-the-worlds-most-walkable-city.html></a>
For exactly a century, Dublin has been probably the most famously walkable city in the world, from a literary perspective anyway. In 1922, James Joyce published Ulysses, his masterpiece of modernism, his total overhaul of the novel form, the Most Unread Great Book of All Time, etc. But when stripped to its essence, the novel boils down to the story of a man, Leopold Bloom, an advertising agent, who on June 16 walks the streets of Dublin from morning until well into the night.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is it possible to holiday in your hometown following tragic personal experiences?

I am sitting cross-legged in front of the TV in my creased school uniform in our home in St.Austell, Cornwall. I know something ominous is happening as I watch the morning news and a multitude of tanks are racing across the Kuwaiti desert. My cereal is getting soggy and I can hear my mother’s shrill tones in her panicked calls to relatives. This is always how I remember 1991. My father was working in Kuwait and would shortly become one of Saddam Hussein’s 'guestages' at a petrochemical facility in Basra.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Jenna Ortega Pregnant?

No, Vineyard crime is of a more benign nature. It can be split up into season and off-season varieties. The seasonal type does resemble off -Island crime, and is usually perpetrated by off-Island criminals. Is Martha's Vineyard safe?
