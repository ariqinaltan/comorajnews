<a href=../../../../64ec8dd5268e3e27418b458d-html.html></a>
Bullfighting is one of the most dangerous 'sports' in the world. If the bullfighter doesn't execute his job perfectly, it can end in tragedy. Just putting a foot wrong could have life-threatening consequences.
In a recent episode in Cusco, Perú, young bullfighter Sandro Villalobos López was brutally impaled by a giant bull after being knocked and charged by the terrifying animal. After failing to get up after the initial blow, the bull relentlessly smashed him with his foot-long horns which inflicted horrifying injuries to the man.</article><article class=post-entry><h2></h2><time>Aug 6, 2024</time>

Jhene Aiko's long-awaited debut album, Souled Out&nbsp;is dropping next week, and the free spirited singer has gained a considerable amount of hype around the release. While her Sail Out EP featured plenty of rap features, her new effort will be made up of solo recordings for the most part, which is surprising, considering the high profile connections she's been able to make since rising to fame.&nbsp;
Drake and Childish Gambino have been two of Jhene's closer collaborators, and naturally, rumors sparked that she was dating one if not both of them over the last year or so.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Grizzly Bear Ready, Able lyrics</h2><time>Aug 6, 2024</time>

Diehard fans will most appreciate Del Shores’ belated sequel to Sordid Lives, his 2000 indie hit comedy about the entwined lives of numerous colorful characters, several of them gay, in the Bible Belt town of Winters, Texas. Featuring many of the original castmembers as well as newcomers in several key roles, this installment delivers much of the same brand of raucous, gay-themed humor that propelled its predecessor to surprising success. It’s also following in the footsteps of the first film, which enjoyed a run of nearly two years in a Palm Springs theater; in the same location, A Very Sordid Wedding grossed an impressive $40,000 in its opening weekend.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>2.7 cm to feet and inches</h2><time>Aug 6, 2024</time>
