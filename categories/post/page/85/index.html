The move follows a recent spat between Petrobras and shareholders over dividend payments, which heightened concerns about the government's influence in the publicly traded company's decision-making.
Jean Paul Prates, a former state senator and ally Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, "has been dismissed," a presidential spokesman said Tuesday evening.
A lawyer and economist, Prates was appointed last January by the Petrobras board of directors soon after leftist Lula was sworn in for a third term.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cole Bennett Net Worth 2024: What Is The Lyrical Lemonade Founder Worth?</h2><time>Aug 17, 2024</time>
