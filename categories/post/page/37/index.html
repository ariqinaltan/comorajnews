<a href=../../../../avatar-the-last-airbender-costume-designer.html></a>
2005’s Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best examples of world-building put to screen in television history—thanks in large part to the show's fashion. The Nickelodeon animated series pulled its viewers into the magical universe of “benders,” by giving each of the world’s four nations—the Fire Nation, the Earth Kingdom, the Water Tribe, and the Air Nomads—a distinct, recognizable aesthetic inspired by Asian and Indigenous cultures. The original ATLA also handled intricate character arcs and heavy themes around war and colonialism with a nuance that both kids and adults could appreciate, and the gorgeous 2D animation sucked every viewer deeply into the fantasy world.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Avoid the water skiing douche</h2><time>Aug 25, 2024</time>

Though its natural to think of external water skiing injuries, such as broken limbs, there are a range of internal injuries that can also occur. Rarely mentioned but potentially fatal, women can suffer from serious injuries to the vagina, perineal area and rectum (men can also sustain perineal and rectal injuries). These types of injuries, referred to as the “water skiing douche” or “water skiing enema,” are potentially life threatening and if left untreated can result in heavy blood loss and death.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Can you join the Enclave?</h2><time>Aug 25, 2024</time>
