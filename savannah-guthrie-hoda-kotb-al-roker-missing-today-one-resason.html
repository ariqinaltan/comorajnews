Hoda and Savannah's week-long absence is likely a result of both hosts choosing to spend the national celebration with their families away from the responsibilities of the TV studio for one week.</p><p id=eDmbNLMwdJIq data-wc=70>The popular show <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>hosted a huge concert</a></strong> in advance of this Tuesday's holiday on Friday, and with today's news that July 4th will be affected by bad weather, the studio must be delighted they had such a successful time before the weekend.
