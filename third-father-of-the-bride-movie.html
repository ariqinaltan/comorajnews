So maybe that’s just a question of that happening.”</p><p>The first&nbsp;Father of the Bride&nbsp;was a major box office success when it was released in 1991. Steve Martin starred as an overprotective father struggling to let go of his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams-Paisley. Newbern played Annie's fiancé (and later husband), while Diane Keaton starred as Martin's wife. In 1995, the entire cast reunited for&nbsp;Father of the Bride Part II.&nbsp;Since then, there's been little news beyond rumors of a third installment and back in 2014, Martin&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://ew.com/article/2014/06/17/steve-martin-father-of-the-bride-3/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>denied involvement in a potential third film</a>. But now that a script exists, reunion whispers have reignited.</p><p>Though Newbern remained coy on details about the potential third film, he did reveal where he thought his character Bryan would be 22 years later. The sequel left off with Annie and Bryan moving to Boston from California with their baby for a job opportunity. But now? "I think Bryan MacKenzie would probably be a grandfather,"&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/father-of-the-brides-george-newbern-says-there-is-a-third-movie-script-w508020 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Newbern said</a>. "They had a kid so he’s probably got a grandkid at this point."<br></p><p>While details about a third film remain slim, Newbern did say it will be&nbsp;different.
