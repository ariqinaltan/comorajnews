Many NBA teams, for example, used these disses to warm up for playoff games, and the competitive nature of the feud inspired a lot of takes from sports commentators. In fact, we even saw Shaq have a little bit of fun by <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">parodying the "BBL Drizzy" beat on Inside The NBA</a> alongside Chuck, Kenny, and Ernie. But Shaquille O'Neal recently had to explain a bizarre edited picture that he posted of him chilling on a boat with presumably his girl or a female friend... with the 6ix God's face placed over hers and "BBL Drizzy" playing in the background.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Let me apologize right quick," Shaq's explanation of the whole thing began during his latest episode of The Big Podcast. "I sent out a picture the other day. The mistake I made was that I should've said, 'Who did this?' Because I want Drake to know... Listen, Drake has a great sense of humor, so <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I thought it was funny that they did it</a>. I don't want him to think -– like, I saw 'Shaq's trolling.' No, I'm not trolling.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-shaq-explains-bbl-drizzy-post>Shaq Explains "BBL Drizzy" Post</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"No, I didn't Photoshop it," Shaq continued. "Somebody Photoshopped it and I actually saw it and I took the picture. So, Drake, I apologize. I should have put 'Who was this?' on there, because I don't want you to think I did that. Somebody sent it to me, I thought it was funny and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">hopefully you thought it was funny, too</a>. But once it went viral, I definitely took it down. But, so, my bad, big Drake."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Drake is already moving onto bigger fish to fry, and has some song of the summer contenders with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his new collabs</a> with Camila Cabello. But folks are still spreading a lot of memes and hilarious content about the Kendrick Lamar battle, and we're sure that Shaq has many other takes on it. We'll see whether more celebrities join in on the fun, although they're pretty late if they're just getting started. Nevertheless, don't let Stan Twitter fool you: not everyone's diving in Reddit rabbit holes to have fun with this rap-off.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZ313hZZmqqGZoWKxs63KnmSbmpxisbO12bOwZpmgpLmws9hmnLGonJa2r7HDZp%2BiqF2dvLF5zZ6urA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./multiversus-trailer-batman-shaggy-html.html><span>←</span><span>See MultiVersus Trailer Reveal A Fighting Game Featuring Batman And Shaggy</span></a>
