His inaugural collection was dedicated to a "flower woman": that woman was Catherine Dior, who at the time had become a horticulturist, producing the roses which would form the base of the house's very first <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/fragrance/a46502954/perfume-sillage/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=perfume, class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">perfume,</a> Miss Dior, named in her honour.</p><img alt="maisie williams in the new look" title="The New Look" width=6106 height=4070 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/thenewlook-101-03039f-6555fb17df694.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Roger Do Minh</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Apple</span><p>Maisie Williams as Catherine Dior in The New Look</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Catherine was the woman he loved best in the world, and she was his first model," Picardie explained. "She was emaciated when she returned to France, from the concentration camps, so the soft padding you'll find in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a30890145/dior-bar-jacket/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bar jacket" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Bar jacket</a>, on the hips, the bust and the shoulders, provide a kind of protection to his beloved younger sister, who he had not been able to protect. I find that tenderness really emotional."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The fashion of The New Look is, of course, a foundational tenet of the show and a character in its own right. For esteemed costume designer Muller Serreau, capturing such an iconic moment in fashion was a unique challenge, alongside costuming the wartime years and sartorial changes in the cast. For Williams (whom she praised for "doing all her own stunts") the task was to dress "an everyday person who could hide and blend in", who then becomes one of the very first Dior models.<br></p><img alt="christian dior played by ben bendelsohn" title="The New Look" width=5472 height=3648 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/thenewlook-107-01419f-6555fc1540da7.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Roger Do Minh</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Apple</span><p>Christian Dior himself is played by Ben Mendelsohn in the series</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We were incredibly careful with the costumes that we created for the fashion shows," she said. "We put cloth down on the ground, the girls that were dressing [the models] had to wear gloves and we had to shout to everybody on the set to move everything out of the way to make the space for them to get through."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The costumes were made with incredible attention to detail, the corsetry and padding all made to replicate some of fashion's most formational looks. Extreme wartime rationing had produced such malnourishment that Muller Serreau noted how shocked she was by the miniscule measurements of the original garments. Picardie shared a meeting she had with the late Pierre Cardin, who led the first Dior atelier and told her he still remembered the extraordinary proportions – "those tiny, tiny waists" – of 1947's 'The New Look.'</p><img alt="the new look screener" title="The New Look screener" width=7944 height=5299 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-new-look-9-65d377482f360.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>"I hope this series will bring the story of this immensely courageous young woman to a larger audience and to a new generation," said Picardie of Catherine Dior</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Muller Serreau, the show is a love letter to the resilience of her own craft. "In occupied France, the Nazis wanted to take the fashion industry to Berlin," she said. "And so living and working in this industry in Paris today, it means so much. This story is about survival and how creative people use their imagination to get through difficult moments."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Picardie added that she hopes people will take the message of optimism and rebirth from the story, before sharing how much Bazaar itself is enmeshed in the history of Dior.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was Carmel Snow, Bazaar's editor at the time, who coined the phrase," she said. "That first collection was called Corolle, but rather than saying that, which probably wouldn't have translated very well for the readers of Harper's Bazaar, she says, 'Ah, my dear Christian, it's such a new look!'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">'The New Look' is streaming now on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/the-new-look/umc.cmc.6m0i5dcn60uzl206qq6ibomeh?ctx_brand=tvs.sbd.4000&mttn3pid=Google%20AdWords&mttnagencyid=a5e&mttncc=UK&mttnsiteid=143238&mttnsubad=OUK20191115_1-689462223788-c&mttnsubkw=157679524036__7Ue1VmfC_&mttnsubplmnt=_adext_" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Apple TV+" data-vars-ga-product-id=bc9931d2-bc93-4621-80fa-1524566e1f91 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/the-new-look/umc.cmc.6m0i5dcn60uzl206qq6ibomeh?ctx_brand=tvs.sbd.4000&mttn3pid=Google%20AdWords&mttnagencyid=a5e&mttncc=UK&mttnsiteid=143238&mttnsubad=OUK20191115_1-689462223788-c&mttnsubkw=157679524036__7Ue1VmfC_&mttnsubplmnt=_adext_" data-product-url="https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/the-new-look/umc.cmc.6m0i5dcn60uzl206qq6ibomeh?ctx_brand=tvs.sbd.4000&mttn3pid=Google%20AdWords&mttnagencyid=a5e&mttncc=UK&mttnsiteid=143238&mttnsubad=OUK20191115_1-689462223788-c&mttnsubkw=157679524036__7Ue1VmfC_&mttnsubplmnt=_adext_" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftv.apple.com%2Fgb%2Fshow%2Fthe-new-look%2Fumc.cmc.6m0i5dcn60uzl206qq6ibomeh%3Fctx_brand%3Dtvs.sbd.4000%26mttn3pid%3DGoogle+AdWords%26mttnagencyid%3Da5e%26mttncc%3DUK%26mttnsiteid%3D143238%26mttnsubad%3DOUK20191115_1-689462223788-c%26mttnsubkw%3D157679524036__7Ue1VmfC_%26mttnsubplmnt%3D_adext_" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=600cb887-9064-453d-986c-7a7260c72913 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Apple TV+</a></p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7wG1tcWlgZoZ6e9OhnGamlax6rbvOpGSbqpmptrS0jJ%2BYrKCZpLtur86upZyhnGLApL7EnqWippdk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sonny-arguinzoni-net-worth-income-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sonny Arguinzoni Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
