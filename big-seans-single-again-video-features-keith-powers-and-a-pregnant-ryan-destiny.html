Ryan and Keith were only playing a couple feuding over the cheating allegations against Big Sean.</p><h2>Big Sean cautions on the power of social media</h2><p>Big Sean explained in a series of posts to Twitter that the video portrays the absurdity of celebrity scandals. He said it is how people react to them and blame one party or exonerate the other when they have no reliable information or evidence to back up the stories they are hearing.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I shot this video in Detroit, hired locally in the city and we made it with good energy n all love.</p><p>— Sean Don (@BigSean) <a href=#>July 29, 2019</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I know what it’s like to be in social scandals where even with no information/ evidence, just people assuming will blame you and turn on you.</p><p>— Sean Don (@BigSean) <a href=#>July 29, 2019</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s something that’s been happening to black men especially forever and I wanted to touch on that n show how social media has the power to sway people’s opinion to the point of hatred.</p><p>— Sean Don (@BigSean) <a href=#>July 29, 2019</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is also a video of love and a beautiful couple who has to decide is it better to be separate or understand each other’s difference be stronger from it.
