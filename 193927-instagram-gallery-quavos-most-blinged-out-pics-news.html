While there's no denying that each member of Migos brings their own charisma, flavor and talent behind the mic, Quavo set himself aside from the pack when he killed his feature on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a>'s 2015 track <span class=text-line>"Oh&nbsp;My&nbsp;Dis&nbsp;</span><span class=text-line>Side."</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=text-line>Popularizing the now iconic triplet flow that other rappers like Drake, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a> and Kanye have now used within their own bodies of work, Quavo's signature flow has earned him the title of the pop-rap hybrid feature king. Hopping on tracks from Billboard-charting stars like Liam Payne and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DJ Khaled</a>, Quavo is arguably the most popular of the three Migos, able to command a track with equally catchy hooks and bars.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=text-line>Aside from his musical ability, Quavo also takes great care to look and live the part of a superstar. Always down to flex his ever-expanding ice collection on the 'Gram and show off his megawatt smile often sporting a diamond-spattered grill, Quavo knows the weight of his drip and is happy to flash it for his fans.&nbsp;</span>Sitting down with GQ, the "Ice Tray" rapper showed off his "insane" jewelry collection to clue fans in on just how important it is to keep his wrists, chest, ears and mouth so frozen.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=text-line>Proving that his obsession with statement pieces goes back far beyond his recent celebrity, Quavo even continued with a long list of his jewelry heroes. "Gucci, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Busta Rhymes</a>, Slick Rick...I even liked the way Sammy Davis Jr. used to rock his jewelry," says the ATL rapper. "Master P, Johnny Dang...all the Houston rappers. They killed the grills. But make sure you got a big enough bankroll put up before you go buyin' this jewelry."</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=text-line>To see all of Quavo's iciest, most blinged-out pics, check out the Instagram gallery below.&nbsp;</span></p><p><h2><span class=text-line>Closeup&nbsp;</span></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In case you somehow missed the shine on his grill, Quavo offered his Insta followers an up-close-and-personal view.&nbsp;</p><p><h2><span class=text-line>Flash&nbsp;</span></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=text-line>"Paparazzi," captioned Quavo alongside a&nbsp;shot of his grill which made the light flash like a camera every time it bounced along with his diamond-studded smile.&nbsp;</span></p><p><h2>Jungle Drip&nbsp;</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Any top rapper's ice collection wouldn't be complete with a classic video game-inspired piece.
