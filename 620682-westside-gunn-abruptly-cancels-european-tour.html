Moreover, he planned to begin the tour last Friday (January 13th), but he canceled the whole run on Thursday. As <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">one of the best rappers of the year in 2022</a>, many were surely ecstatic to see the Flygod live.</p><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 15: Westside Gunn attends Black Star In Concert at Sony Hall on November 15, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage)</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Via Instagram in a since-deleted post, Gunn spoke to supporters and fans and explained the bad news.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It was nothing more I wanted to do than to start seeing my supporters around the world. It’s def still a dream and I’m gonna work on it immed to still make it happen, unfortunately this time things weren’t handled right and that’s too far for me to be gone."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, the Buffalo rapper said he lost $50K on plane tickets. Also, he said that "something isn't right and I’m somewhere I’ve never been," which is vague but might refer to behind-the-scenes logistics. Unfortunately, he clarified that he's also unable to provide ticket refunds himself, as he never took deposits. "Ppl out of $40 I’m out 50,000 I spent just on plane tickets!!!" he wrote.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"So I lost but GOD IS THE GREATEST and hopefully one day I’ll see everybody who’s reading this one day in life," he continued. "I’m the number 1 guy for our lane who<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> pushes the culture</a> but if it’s not right we gotta make it right and unfortunately this situation doesn’t have the time to fix."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fortunately, some venues have already responded to Gunn's cancellation with open arms and open minds, despite the frustration. Dublin venue The Sugar Club wrote a message to fans concerning the canceled show.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"We're currently awaiting an official update from Westside Gunn's agent on the status of the tour," they stated. "But we will of course process refunds for all tickets purchased as soon as we have more information. We hope to resolve this by the end of the day."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, the recently announced <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">rap retiree</a> continued his post with an apology to fans.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I have somebody working on me coming out soon now and if u ever hear about me coming again from me it’s Valid!!!!" he wrote. "So get those tickets and I promise u I’ll make it up…</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"But again <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">to all my supporters I love y’all</a> and if u spent that ticket price your blessings will come back 10fold," he concluded. "Just know if u don’t get your money back I don’t have it. And again I REPEAT I can’t give u money back I NEVER got paid I’m down 50k of my own money."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Westside Gunn canceling his European tour?

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmZ313hJFmrp6rpKi2pbGMoKynpl2Wr7PBz62jsmWTlrukscusZJ6toqS9pq3NZquoraI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vanessa-hudgens-avoids-ex-austin-butler-at-2023-oscars-video.html><span>←</span><span>Vanessa Hudgens Avoids Ex Austin Butler at 2023 Oscars: Video</span></a>
